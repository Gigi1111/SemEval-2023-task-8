1,rtp06t,t5_2syer,"Allopurinol works, an anecdote with lots of data
I'm a 50+ male who was diagnosed with gout in 2018 (but probably had it for years prior).  I'm not a fan of taking drugs as the side effects can be significant and efficacy questionable. I read r/gout for a couple of years and went through at least 9 bouts of pain, 2-3 of them ""9+"". I became convinced that allo was safe and had few side effects, so started taking 1 year ago. I bought a UASure and tested by UA levels bi-weekly (usually) and recording my perceived pain levels. I'm 6'+ and 200+ so I decided to increase from 300mg to 500mg pretty early and have stayed there, although I'm considering dropping back down to 300mg (mostly because one pill is easier than 3 (300+100+100)).

I thought I would just have to live with foot pain for the rest of my life but now its a rare (and getting rarer) event.

3,scxofi,t5_2saq9,"Poor mans TTT/POTS criteria:
I think I have only officially posted like 3 times for being the OP but do make a lot of comments but wanted to get my wording right and not give false information.

~I will be editing this post as suggestions come~

Would you say that this would be the correct way to meet the criteria for POTS:

ONLY YOU know whats NORMAL for you and YOUR body so if you have ANY abnormal symptoms you should always speak to your doctor about your concerns.

For possible P.O.T.S you can do a Poor mans TTT at home and then discuss with your doctor. I would recommend saving your results on paper or on video so they can see proof and have a better understanding of whats happening but a lot of other conditions can cause POTS symptoms so they may need to run a lot of test and be patient because POTS is a process of elimination.

When doing the Poor Mans Tilt Test its best to do it for the full 10 mins and to check blood pressure as well if possible.Here is a chart that I used if you are interested:

https://batemanhornecenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/NASA-Lean-Test-Instructions-1.pdf

https://imgur.com/a/H36mjvF

If you meet the PoTs criteria:

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a blood circulation disorder characterized by two factors:

A specific group of symptoms that frequently occur when standing upright(but also with other postural changes): 
Lightheadedness,dizziness,chest pressure,Brain fog,Palpitations,Blood pooling,Feeling faint or actually fainting;just to name a few.
(You do not need to have all of the above)

A heart rate increase from horizontal(try to rest for at least 2-5 minutes to get resting heart rate)to standing (or as tested on a tilt table) of at least 30 beats per minute in adults, or at least 40 beats per minute in adolescents, measured during the first 10 minutes of standing and is sustained above the 30bpm increase after the initial rise.

*That means that even if it didnt rise immediately but within the 10 minute timeframe it counts but should be over the 30bpm after it ramps up and doesnt drop below the threshold.*

A persons resting heart rate ranges from 60-100 and upon standing the heart rate increases *up to 30+*beats per minute when standing up, and then it settles down again by 2 minutes. For people with postural tachycardia syndrome, the heart rate goes up considerably higher when they stand, often increasing 30 to 50 beats per minute or more and is sustained over the 30bpm within the 10 minute time frame.This can lead to lightheadedness, dizziness and fainting.

*The most important thing to note is that the HR is sustained above the +30/40 resting rate while standing and doesnt drop below*

~If your heart rate is still around +20/+25 and is still sustained over after two minutes you may still have Pots or some other form of dysautonomia or other condition and as always best to speak to your doctor about it.~

POTS is diagnosed only when orthostatic hypotension is ruled out and when there is no acute dehydration or blood loss. Orthostatic hypotension is a form of low blood pressure: 20mm Hg drop in systolic or a 10mm Hg drop in diastolic blood pressure in the first three minutes of standing upright.

>Researchers have discovered how genes that protect against Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) become silent or switched off and have identified a drug to switch them on again.

>POTS is one of a group of disorders that have orthostatic intolerance as their primary symptom, in which a reduced volume of blood returns to the heart after the person stands up from a lying-down position. A main symptom in a third of POTS patients is fainting. 

>The researchers were from Monash University and led by Professor Sam El-Osta who said that while the gene implicated in POTS  norepinephrine transporter (NET)  had been known for several decades, past research had failed to find a genetic mutation responsible for the symptoms. This latest study revealed that the enzyme EZH2 is responsible for silencing this gene.

>""We predicted that inhibiting this epigenetic condition could reactivate NET gene function and used a pharmacological drug called GSK-126 that could specifically inhibit EZH2 activity with dramatic results, Professor Sam El-Osta said. This is the first description of NET reactivation using a drug. The beauty is that it allows us to target very specifically the enzyme to reactivate gene function.

>Currently there is no specific pharmacological treatment available for POTS, which affects mainly people aged 18 to 50 years, 80 percent of whom are women. Were far from it now and clinical trials would need to be conducted, but the new drug could lead to better management of POTS, he continued.

Hi gang. Im wondering if anyone has experienced a relapse that does not show new lesion activity on MRI? I had my scans at the beginning of Feb and all is stable (yay!). But I started having some weakness in my arm around the same time and it was a bit insidious in that it was kind of slow to come on and then got worse quite quickly. I had been having sensory issues in that arm for so long (neuro aware) but I had a disc issue in my c spine last year so I chalked it up to that. My MRI shows that disc issue is fully resolved and back its vertebrae house (also yay!). But my left arm and hand are very weak and it has spread across my shoulders. I also have spasticity in my left armpit, my ribcage is in pain and feels tight. My specialist is not convinced that what is happening right now is mechanical, which was my assumption and why I waited to report the symptoms until my arm was so weak that I couldnt really function very well. Which in hindsight, I should have called earlier. I just assumed it was my neck and upper back acting up and that it would get better. I really struggle sometimes determining what is just my back being my back and what is related to MS. 

I feel pretty confused by all of this because I dont have any lesions in my spinal cord showing on an MRI and nothing new in my brain, though for some reason they didnt use contrast this time for any of my scans and perhaps something small was missed in my spine? My specialist is concerned that based on my symptom presentation and the exam that my spinal cord is inflamed and that I am having a relapse. He said that MRIs cannot see everything and it doesnt pick up small lesions or all of the inflammation that is happening in the CNS. He has prescribed me a course of the devils tictacs (steroids ) to take to try and speed things up and reduce symptoms. 

Has this happened to any of you before where your MRI looked stable with no progression but you were having a relapse? I googled and I found a lot about this happening in SPMS or PPMS but I am still fairly early in my disease as per my neuro.

Hope you guys all have a nice weekend.

New member, Looking for some advice here.  (Sorry for the long post, half of it is me trying to comfort myself). 

I am 42 yr old healthy male. I used to workout 4 times a week weight lifting and cardio, seriously eating healthy and my weight is in the right bmi. 

Few months ago did a full health test. My hba1c, blood pressure, cholesterol heart everything came normal, but uric acid, blood urea etc came high. Uric acid was close to 7. I was on a keto diet at time and peeing a lot so doc told it could be dehydration. Egfr was 67. So a month later I did another test and egfr was in the 80s. But they didnt do the uric acid. Anyways doc told nothing to worry. 


Fast forward two weeks ago, everyone at home got covid, starting with kids. I also got it but it was pretty mild - with just a dry cough and loss of smell.  10 days post symptoms, on the 11th day I was sleeping in the couch. Woke up after an hour and I had a small pain in my right ankle like a sprain. It pains when I twist my ankle. I thought I sprained my leg whilst in the sleep. Next day there was some swelling around the ankle - walking was a bit painful like I was limping. The day after I had some strong pain - then I took an ibuprofen and the pain became less also the swelling got better as well, but still when I twist the ankle it pains and whilst walking. So I called nhs and my  gp rang back. She told me that some people get joint pain after covid and she also told me could it be gout? Then I told her about the uric acid and she asked me to come in after a week for a full kidney test. I also have foamy urine occasionally, when I dont drink enough water.

Gp told me to keep taking ibuprofen and rest. Yesterday worked in the bed, didnt walk around much. Today 3rd day, I woke up and the pain has subsided significantly, I mean whilst twisting the ankle. All this time I was able to walk but limping and there was no pain when I give weight on the leg. Also I heard alcohol and red meat makes gout worse, so last night I ate some pork sausages and had two 50 ml cognac to see if its flares up, but it didnt.

On thursday, I had my second Tonic Clonic seizure in less than two months. I'm T1D and my blood sugars went low. I remember having my Myoclonic seizures which are just muscle jerks, and I took some sugar and was on my phone, sitting on the floor in our basement, with my siblings, waiting for my numbers to come up. The next thing I remember was passing out and then waking up to some random dudes in our basement, and my step mother helping me stand up. Turns out, I went unconsious and had a tonic clonic seizure, then started acting like a tired wacko once they kind of got my attention, without me remembering it, so my step mother called an ambulance. The dudes in our basement were paramedics and firemen (Idk why the firemen showed up, but thats who my step brother they said showed up). I ended up going into the ambulance where a lady was driving, the guy was trying to talk to me to make sure I was alright, and my step mother grabbed me some food and a T-shirt because I bit my tongue when I fell face first and I had blood on my sweater, and she came in the ambulance with me (Her mother was there to watch the other kids). So I was in a hospital that I'm usually taken to for this stuff, and they were giving me sugar stuff through an IV. My step mother stayed with me until my mom came to swap out with her (Only one parent allowed in per patient at a time). I ended up getting out at 2am on friday and my mom drove me back to my step mother's house to get some sleep. 

Apparently while I was being a wacko, I latched onto my step mother's arm and she had to pry me off, and then I just randomlt pulled at her pants. 

Apparently my 3yo half sister was there, somehow knows what a seizure is, and will tell you that I had a seizure and will tell you the sounds I make during those seizures. My muscles are sore as hell, but now I might get a reason out of gym lmao.

Moderna announces first participant dosed in phase 1 study of its mRNA Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) vaccine.

Moderna expects to enrol approximately 270 participants in the U.S.

EBV is a major cause of infectious mononucleosis, which can debilitate patients for weeks to months; there is no approved vaccine to prevent EBV

EBV can also lead to lifelong medical conditions and is associated with an increased risk of developing multiple sclerosis, certain lymphoproliferative disorders, cancers, and autoimmune diseases.



**Prof. Giovannoni:**

*After reviewing the epidemiological data about the association between EBV and MS in the late nineties I become convinced that EBV is the cause of MS. One of the reasons why I moved academic institutions, from UCL to Queen Mary University of London, was to study EBV and to develop an MS prevention research programme. Despite being very positive I found that it was difficult to convince my colleagues and the wider MS community to invest in EBV-MS research. I was fortunate enough to get an MRC grant application, but since then I must have had at least 20 grant applications around the EBV-MS hypothesis rejected. It is very disheartening when this happens.*

*The good news is that in 2017 Professor Nick Wald, Director of the Wolfson Institute of Preventive Medicine, suddenly realised that the evidence I had presented to him in 2007 was stronger than he had appreciated and agreed with me that EBV was the likely cause of MS. This lead us to hold a workshop on EBV and MS and led to a successful grant application to the Barts Charity to start the Preventive Neurology Unit (PNU).*

***I am often asked why has no MS preventative action been taken? I need to remind people that science moves steadily and slowly and the biggest problem we have is the slow adoption, or rejection, of innovations or new ideas.***

*However, we are pushing on slowly with our plans to create a trial-ready cohort of people at high risk of MS for exploratory MS prevention studies. Dr Ruth Dobson is doing an amazing job at getting this off the ground. We are also taking forward our ideas around treating MS with antivirals that target EBV. To say that the funding for doing these trials has been difficult is an understatement, but I am hoping if we can get pilot data we can convince the sceptics to fund larger more definitive trials.*

*I cant tell how excited I am that Modernas EBV vaccine has entered phase 1 trials and they have openly acknowledged that if it gets to the general public the vaccine may prevent MS. This statement alone is momentous. Why? If we can convince pharma of the importance of the EBV hypothesis maybe we can now convince funders to support a large international MS prevention study.*

*Even if Moderna proves that their EBV vaccine is effective in preventing EBV infection and infectious mononucleosis we will still have to overcome the public resistance to vaccination and convince public health officials that using EBV vaccination to prevent MS is a worthy objective. The battles ahead are numerous, but we will get there in the end. We have to. We dont want the next generation of pwMS asking us why we havent done anything to prevent MS given the current state of knowledge.*



**Who is Prof. Gavin Giovannoni?**

Gavin Giovannoni was appointed to the Chair of Neurology, Blizard Institute of Cell and Molecular Science, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London and the Department of Neurology, Barts and The London NHS Trust in November 2006.

My heart rate went up by about 45 beats on the table tilt test. Also positive active standing test. (I think it went up even more that time) 

My letter says it's possibly autonomic dysfunction/ POTS and I'm being prescribed a beta blocker with the possibility of ivabradine if I don't get on with that but it also says theres a possibility of functional factors which I feel is just code for psychological. I looked up what that means and apprently that can mean medically unexplained symptoms like how could they say its possibly medically unexplained when it is! I have all but one of the symptoms of POTS (I don't fully pass out) I've had a positive standing test and a table test with other factors being out. Even compression socks help my symptoms. 

I could actually understand how they could say that if I didn't have a positive table test and standing test (with symptoms of POTS which I also had during the test) 

It feels to me some doctors (especially in the UK) will do anything to avoid just giving a concrete diagnosis or will just always find a way to try and make their a possibility of a psychological issue instead of seeing we struggle with those symptoms because this crap ruins our lives.  

I've been dealing with these symptoms for 5 years, ive lost my whole early and my mid 20's to this crap. I've been bullied over my symptoms , dismissed etc - of course I will have some degree of depression in response to this.

Today was my follow up appointment with my rheumatologist to discuss my bloodwork and x rays. It was probably one of the most significant doctor appointments Ive had and yet it was the quickest appointment ever. I felt like someone dropped a bomb on me and then left. So now Im left with lots of questions. 

She told me I have a mild form of lupus but because Im young (22F) I need to start medication to prevent future damage. She prescribed me Hydroxychloroquine which is a bit scary for me because I know its a long term commitment and can come with many negative side effects.

40,spvgbf,t5_2s23e,"Flax seed oil, testosterone, and MS
Hello!  Im a guy with MS who has previously had low testosterone numbers pre-dx (eg below 12 nmol/L).  Ive been feeling especially crappy lately (low energy stuff).  So rather than just accept its MS, I dove into the rabbit hole of trying to find why I feel crappy and came across something interesting that may affect others in here.

Since my dx, Ive been taking supplements to help control my MS.  And my regime and DMT have worked.  My MS went from highly active at dx to NEDA now.  One thing I do every day is I take a flax seed oil + curcumin capsule.

Flax seed oil reduces relapses by 60% according to this study by Dr Jelinik (of OMS diet):

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3821380/

Awesome.  I am only taking 1x1000mg capsule daily- not a lot.  However, apparently when taking with curcumin + piperine, absorption is increased.  

Now, back to me feeling crappy.  I went to an endocrinologist, described symptoms I was having, and she sent me for a blood panel.  It came back with a ridiculously high testosterone number.  Like almost 30 nmol/L - an unnatural number for my age and totally inconsistent with my prior panel.  I should be rocking a massive erection constantly.  But instead, its barely even just okay.  Likewise with body hair, I dont have very much.  And Im hardly very muscular either.  Somethings not right with that number.

So I started reading and found an association between flax seed oil and testosterone that fit:

The reason that flaxseeds are on the hit list for raising testosterone is because they are rich in lignans, which tend to mimic estrogen in the body. Since estrogen is the opposing sex hormone to testosterone, the more of it you have (particularly if you are a man), the more low testosterone-like symptoms youll have. (from: https://www.shawacademy.com/blog/6-foods-to-avoid-to-optimise-natural-testosterone/ )

Also its discussed at length in setting of PCOS at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2752973/

Whats interesting is, testosterone is associated with a neuroprotective effect in MS.  (from: https://www.mdedge.com/multiplesclerosishub/article/134428/multiple-sclerosis/testosterone-affects-outcomes-men-ms ).

The effect of estrogen-mimicking lignans fits as a culprit for feeling crappy in a hypogonadism sense - but it also seems to fit the unexplained data from Dr Jeliniks study showing how much more effective flax seed oil was compared to other Omega-3s, since lignans are a unique element not found in fish oils.

If only that Omega-3 study had an endocrine panel, this theory might be solved.  It seems like tapering down flax seed oil intake would help me feel better- but could also reduce beneficial effect of the high testosterone on my MS.

Hi
I was curious if anyone else here has tried an anti-inflammatory diet for managing gout. I got my first attack in February and was following the advice of avoiding high purine foods. I found something on YouTube which talked about inflammation being the main culprit behind gout flare ups. The guy on that video was suggesting a keto diet which I haven't done. I've mostly tried to cut out a lot of extra carbs and really limit my alcohol intake. I've been taking turmeric and lots of ginger, as well. It seems to have worked, until a couple days ago I started to feel a flare up after a couple days of drinking more beer.

Hi all, hope everyone is feeling ok today and not having a bad flare. I got diagnosed a little over a month ago after having symptoms for 7 months. I saw my cardiologist last week for a treatment plan/medicine and she said I do not have the tachycardia portion of pots (which I am lucky for) but I have all the symptoms of dizziness, anxiety, stomach issues, etc so she said it is like a variant of the standard POTS. Due to this, there is no medicine she can give me to help me feel better as I do not have super high heart rate and all the meds she could give me will cause me more problems. 
Just curious if anyone out there in the reddit group has something similar? I am starting a new position at work which will eventually be 100% work from home once I am trained but need to feel better/not sick while training bc need to retain the info and be in office 100% for 2-3 weeks.

55,sqckaa,t5_2s23e,"Anyone has local injection site reactions on Kesimpta?
Hi,

I am having bad reaction on Plegridy (red big patches that itch long after injection was administered). It has been few months and it hasn't gotten better. I didn't have this on Betaseron, and since both are interferon I compared the additives in these injection to find the culprit.

What **Plegridy** injections have extra apart from **Betaferon (Betaseron)**  is

*L-*[*arginine*](https://www.rxlist.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=7006) *HCl* 

[*sodium acetate*](https://www.rxlist.com/sodium-acetate-drug.htm) *trihydrate*

*glacial* [*acetic acid*](https://www.rxlist.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=32085) \- this I found is strong skin and mucus membrane irritant

*polysorbate 20* \- possible allergen

**And Kesimpta has**

 *e L-arginine*

 *sodium acetate trihydrate*

*polysorbate 80* \- possible alergen

*disodium edetate dihydrate*

 *hydrochloric acid* 

So, I am hoping that the problematic ingredients giving me itchy red patches that don't fade is the glacial acetic acid which is NOT in Kesimpta. But it could also be the polysorbate, which is in both. By my own deduction, the irritating ingredient is the one which purpose it is to make the drug release gradually. Because it gets worse after 7-10th day after injection.

I am afradit I will fight for this drug and end up with the same reactions. My doctor told me I am THE ONLY ONE of his patients having local site reactions to Plegridy. Which is strange, because he said he has many patients on Plegridy and I found that according to leaflet 66% of patients have it. And only around 11% have local site reactions to Kesimpta, which is hopeful to me

I will appreciate any thoughts - reassurance from those who don't local site reaction, or replies from those who do have, or any experience going from interferon to Kesimpta.

My doctor is not of much help with this, they just suggested K-vitamin cream, which does nothing, because my skin is irritated and not bruised. They see a bruise and think it is a bruise. What helps a little bit are antihistamine cream and pills, but I don't want to take the pill every day and it doesn't help that much.

Still, my doctors have been very reluctant to prescribe allopurinol as a preventative measure since I don't suffer often enough. After a *lot* of pushing, however, I managed to persuade my doctor to write a ""just in case"" prescription of colchicine to have on hand should I ever need it.

Last time this happened he wrote me a prescription for 6 pills. I took 3, and it ended a month-long flareup in two days. So I was definitely a fan. This just-in-case script was for 60 pills. To just have on hand. (Only cost me $30 without even having a drug plan - so grateful to live in this country!)

68,sg1edo,t5_2syer,"Flare Medication Advice
Had a flare up (ongoing) started about 10 days ago, and was prescribed indomethicin (the usual prescription) and also Colchicine (which I have never had before) - recommended as an-on in case the indo by itself didn't work.  Maybe get 2-3 flares a year...but more if I put a lot of pressure on my feet from over-use or get dehydrated etc.

The flare seems to have been caused by a new ARB and FloMax prescription for some blood pressure and prostate concerns....but I digress...still working on that possibility.

Anyways...the indo alone was not working, so added the colchicine....a bit better, but still getting up/downs (and a wonky stomach too) and last night was horrible.  Went to the local clinic for more advice as can't get to my regular doc on short notice, and he suggested prednisone.  We discussed (after seeing many posts here) also going on Allopurinal for a longer term solution once I get this bout fixed and I'll look at that down the road.

Problem is, I am not sure if I should be continuing the indo AND the colchicine AND prednisone I got today all at the same time?  Seems to be an either/or, not both...but I forgot or did not get clear advice.  Just a few hours after taking the prednisone, I could literally feel the gout ""melt"" away and pain is almost completely gone already....wow.

Pharmacy is closed tomorrow as well as doctor.  

Thoughts....I realize medical advice + internet is highly suspect...but also think many here have been in the same boat.  I'm thinking of dropping the indo and colchicine and ONLY taking the prednisone as that seems to be what I read?

For most of my life since I was a teenager, it's been a common occurence to just randomly smell like shit (according to other people). 

To my knowledge, I'm not farting, and when I go to bathroom and wipe to make sure there's been no leakage, there's *never* anything there.

My main theory is that my outer sphincter is opening very slightly, which allows gases and whatever else to come out without me feeling it. 

One other thing (that should really be its own post) is that when I need to go to the bathroom, I never feel it in my stomach (which is apparently where you're meant to feel it). I always feel it in my rectum, close to the outer sphincter. There's never any warning from my stomach.

I haven't been diagnosed with anything but symptoms is related to gerd/acid reflux and I'm kind of new to all of this gerd stuff. 





Last month, I had the most terrible heartburn (before taking medication) and went to see my GP next day. I told my doctor the problem and the doctor did some quick checkups like blood pressure, oximeter pulse, felt my stomach and liver, listen to my heart beat and said its all good. He then prescribed me lansoprazole 30mg and said to take them for 4 week

I took it on the first day. Nothing special happened and felt the same until on my 5th day, my symptoms gotten better to nothing. Then here is where the mistakes starts to begin. After a few days of dieting from 1-7 days, I started to eat fried food, takeaways, fish and chips, spicy foods, fizzy drinks. Nothing had happened so I thought I was all good. These capsules made hungry a lot so I always have something to eat. Began eating chocolate, crisps, sweets etc. 

I then researched online that I was meant to take it for 2 weeks since its not safe to take long term. Now this is the regret I'm feeling right now. My doctor said to take it for 4 weeks but instead, I only did for 2 weeks just because of anxiety from online. Basically thinking of the worst and negatives on ppi's.

After I stopped on week 2, I just went cold turkey after. Nothing really happened on my first week as I still ate spicy food, takeaways, you name it. Then I started to notice some burning sensation on my chest (mild but it is bothersome) and Then after I completely lost my appetite. 

Now I'm on 2nd week of stopping lansoprazole and I'm still feeling the same like No appetite and burning sensation on the chest. To be honest I don't know if this is acid rebound as somebody said that it feels like ""kicking you in the stomach every 30 seconds"") which I don't feel like that. It's more of a flare up feeling at the moment as it sounds like.

Looking back now, I feel ashamed. I should of done better and researched more. I'm now feeling sad and upset and I don't know if I'm ever gonna be healed. Feeling deepest regrets just writing this post. I should of listened to my doctor and this time I went to take this more seriously.



Coud anybody give me advice in advance. It would be greatly  appreciated. 

Will these symptoms go away?

Should I give it another go? (Think will do it anyways)

Thank you for taking your time reading. 

I will keep updating this post from now on.




Quick Update 24/12/2021: so I went to see my GP and told my mistake. He told me to do a full course this time for 4 week with lansoprazole. He then gave me a stool test for pylori. But since I haven't taken PPI'S for 2 weeks I can do it straight away before I go back to ppi's 

I noticed some symptom I had from 2 days ago. I mentioned that I had no appetite, well it came back yesterday and today aswell. I was so hungry when I was trying to sleep. At the moment, the symptoms I only have is irritation feeling in the chest. It does feeling something wrong tho. It's not painful but bothersome.

I'm hoping to get sorted out soon. I will keep posted from now on. I will let you guys know about the shit test aswell.

Update 1/15/22:

Hello all, so it's been 3 weeks since I'm on ppi's again and I'm feeling OK for starters. The only issue now is throat pain after a little cough. Usually goes away in like 3 seconds but I dont know what it could be but apart from that I'm feeling OK. Doesn't feel burning but more feeling like an ache. I've been eating better than before and drank pretty much just water nearly for a month now. I did a stool test 3 weeks ago and nothing got back to me so hopefully I assume that nothing was there. At the moment I'm tapering and stopping on the 4th week, the hopefully, I can live without them.

So, with lansoprazole, it's been all over the place. When I started I had constant diarrhea for like 4 days. Then after that I had bad constipation. I took a medicine that my dad uses when he has constipation. After that I took like 10ml of it, I had the biggest shit of my life. Big relief after that I think my stomach adjusted itself and now shitting normally I guess?. Anyways, however it messed up my mentality. I feel more tired and waking up the middle of the night. Its Tiring but I'm still fighting. I think that's it really, just affecting my mentality and energy. I think I'm low on b12, magnesium I think but idk. I'm tapering right now so hope for the best I can do this, if not then well, I have to go to the doctors again and request a endoscopy.",claim,I then researched online that I was meant to take it for 2 weeks since its not safe to take long term,1054,1154,101,(S (NP (PRP I)) (ADVP (RB then)) (VP (VBD researched) (ADVP (RB online)) (SBAR (IN that) (S (NP (PRP I)) (VP (VBD was) (VP (VBN meant) (S (VP (TO to) (VP (VB take) (NP (PRP it)) (PP (IN for) (NP (CD 2) (NNS weeks))) (SBAR (IN since) (S (VP (VBZ its) (ADJP (RB not) (JJ safe)) (S (VP (TO to) (VP (VB take) (NP (JJ long) (NN term))))))))))))))))),S,1

I honestly just need to vent and maybe get some advice on how to adapt and deal with what Im calling my new life.

Long story short is that Ive been experiencing symptoms since Aug. 2021 that have gotten more pronounced after a two week attack in late Nov/early Dec that brought on more reoccurring symptoms. I had a head MRI without contrast done Dec. 4 that showed several nonspecific lesions that may be secondary to demyelination. I saw a neurologist Dec. 24 who was convinced it was a b12 deficiency but that came back negative. He offered no follow up to me so I had to go do a Seinfeld style pop-in to convince him to reevaluate me.. but now I have to wait until March for that appointment.

In the meantime Im struggling. Havent worked since Dec. 13 and dont think that I can do back to doing a job where Im on the computer all day because that tends to make my unsteadiness and fatigue worse. Now Im trying to find something low stress and with less time on a screen for work.

**TL;DR:** **Besides therapy, can anyone recommend maybe some good books or videos for coping/adapting to chronic symptoms? Ill list below what Im experiencing but the fatigue, brain fog and unsteady type of dizziness are disrupting my daily life.**

Baseline/Persistent Symptoms

* Rocking/unsteady dizziness
* Tingling/numbness in right leg from knee down
* Fatigue like never before
* Brain fog (short term memory, trouble finding words, focus)
* Frequent urination 12-15 times per day (has been going on for a few years and had ultrasound, digital exam and PSA done in 2020 all negative) \*\*Note: these symptoms worsen with the listed triggers below

Infrequent but reoccurring (brought on by triggers listed below)

* Tingling in hands and face
* Tingling in BOTH legs from knee down
* Ringing in one or both ears for 10 secs at a time (usually once a day)
* Headaches (5/10) maybe once every 10 days

Triggers that make symptoms worse

* Poor sleep (if I dont wear CPAP entire night)
* Stress
* Exercise
* Showers?? Make my leg/feet cold and tingly
* Working on the computer (particularly white screen with black text)",claim,I saw a neurologist Dec. 24 who was convinced it was a b12 deficiency but that came back negative,509,605,97,(S (NP (PRP I)) (VP (VBD saw) (NP (NP (DT a) (NN neurologist)) (NP (NNP Dec.)

I studied on my own as best I could, but I missed almost all of the instruction on the subject. When it came time for the test, I got a much lower score than usual, and it put my overall mark down to a B. I mentioned in passing to my Math teacher that I was sad to have my ""streak"" broken. We had a discussion about the subject of the test where she confirmed that I did understand it sufficiently. Without telling me, she went into her records, looked at all my previous test scores, and came up with an average, which is what she assigned me as a score on that final test.

103,pps8o4,t5_2syer,"Fenofibrate + Gout? (Long)
Hi all,

So appreciative of this community existing; this is going to be a long post so bare with me and thank you in advance.



About 18 months ago, I was prescribed Fenofibrate due to extremely high triglyceride levels that have been a lifelong issue. 

About 6 months after that prescription of daily fenofibrate, I experienced my first gout attack on vacation. 

The pain was 9 out of 10, and at first I had no idea it was gout. I visited the ER thinking it was a broken toe; X-rays confirmed it wasnt, and after given some steroids for the swelling and painkillers, I was sent on my way. 

A few days later I went to urgent care and they estimated it was gout and I ended up going to my GP to seek treatment. 

My GP was great at describing everything and did the following:
- recommended I go on a gout diet
- recommended I stopped drinking (I was having about 4-6 glasses of wine a week - thanks pandemic!)
- prescribed a daily dose of 100mg Allopurinol
- prescribed Colchicine for acute flare ups
- prescribed Indomethacine for acute flare ups

I did everything I was told, and for 8 months I was mostly fine, with two exceptions:
1. The once a month Id have a single drink, I would turn flush. Possibly from liver function side effects from Fenofibrate?
2. My toe never was 100% normal, but there was no pain and it was 95% normal in appearance. 


Ok, all caught up?


2 months ago, I had a flare up of gout. Nothing major, but some toe pain in the 3/10 range. It passed after a few days. Not sure of the trigger event. 


This week however, I had a gout attack in my elbow and the pain has been excruciating. Easily 9/10 pain levels. 

The two possible triggers are:
1. Ive been under a lot of recent stress 
2. I had 2 beers in 3 days

My question, is it possible my gout is being caused by Fenofibrate?

One of the side effects of Fenofibrate is decreased kidney functions - specifically the increase of serum creatinine levels. [here](http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/815413)

Please read the book IBS A New Solution by Dr. Pimental. He explains everything Im about to say and in further detail based on scientific research.

I feel I wouldnt be doing my do-diligence if I didnt speak up on this topic. I was diagnosed with IBS 6 years ago but in my heart felt there was something else going on. I felt the symptoms I was experiencing were way too extreme and my so called IBS was disrupting my life at more of a level than some people I knew with IBS. I was finally diagnosed with Sibo 4 months ago. If you suspect there may be something else wrong with you please look into this!! Most doctors dont know a ton on this topic(including GI DRs) and its a strange breath test to detect. For anyone who believes they just have IBS, please disregard this message. Not trying to cause worry, just want to help if I can. If I can help change one persons life - thats enough. Let me know if you have any questions.

Edit: If you test for Sibo you have to test for all 3 types - Methane Sibo, Hydrogen Sibo, and Hydrogen Sulfide Sibo. The doctors normally only tests for Methane Sibo and Hydrogen Sibo and there is a chance your results will come up negative although you have it. This could be an inconclusive test. The reason for this is that Hydrogen Sulfide Sibo is more dominant and it competes with Methane Sibo to eat Hydrogen Sibo. When the Hydrogen Sibo is gone(all eaten) the Methane Sibo dies off leaving your results for both at 0, but you could still very well have Hydrogen Sulfide Sibo and you wouldnt know it and your DR wouldnt know it. There is a test called Trio smart breath at home test kit that tests for all 3. Order it online and get your doctor to sign off on it if you can. This is really only a concern for anyone who tests at a 0 for Methane and Hydrogen. I tested positive for both but I still need to test for Sulfide Sibo as the protocol for treating this kind is totally different than treating Methane and Hydrogen and is its own kind of beast. If you find you have Sibo get yourself a good intestinal Naturopathic Dr. to help guide you through.

Also, Sibo can cause Sifo (Fungal overgrowth) which can be tested for through a specific Endoscopy that tests for a fungus overgrowth. If you have this as well, you need to treat both. If you do not get rid of the fungus - you cant get rid of the Sibo. Fungus and bacteria compete for a hospitable living environment in your intestinal tract and this causes the bacteria to grow stronger and multiply.",claim,80% of people diagnosed with IBS have Sibo,0,41,42,(S (NP (NP (CD 80) (NN %)) (PP (IN of) (NP (NP (NNS people)) (VP (VBN diagnosed) (PP (IN with) (NP (NNP IBS))))))) (VP (VBP have) (NP (NNP Sibo)))),S,1

Hi everyone,

Im relatively new here, but Ive found so much helpful advice since I was diagnosed in December (33/fRRMS). Thank you!! 

Today I take my second loading dose of Kesimpta. I saw my neuro on Wednesday, and she prescribed me gabapentin to help with neuropathy in my hands, thighs, and the bottoms of my feet. She said I can take up to 900mg a day, or 3 pills, depending on how I feel. Kind of vague instructions, but there you goIm not sure that its that kind of drug, i.e. one that has a relatively immediate effect, like ibuprofen, but perhaps I misunderstood her. 

Ive taken one gabapentin before bed the past two nights. I know a side effect is drowsiness, but it makes me sooo drowsylike fall-asleep-sitting-up drowsy. 

Ive read that this and other common side effects subside within a week or two, and I really want to try this drug to see if it helps; I work with books and, uh, use my hands a lot! My hands (mostly fingers) are by far the worst, and the sudden onset of neuropathy in my fingers is the reason I sought medical tests in the fall.  The numbness and/or tingling has been driving me insane. It has been consistent in my hands since a week before Halloween (and same with skin on my stomachnot sure if its the MS hug, however), and more recently + less intensely it has been on my thighs and the bottom of my feet.  Some days are worse than others, which Ive definitely learned is normal from reading posts on here. Blah! 

Back to gabapentin: I am hesitant to take a second pill mid-afternoon prior to the one before bed, simply because it had made me so tired the last couple of nights. I really dont want to fall asleep in the middle of the dayone reason I dont take Benadryl, no matter how bad allergies are, unless Im going to bed!

*As it was explained to me by my doctor, serotonin is used between immune system cells to communicate and activate immune system responses within the body. Taking an ssri altered these responses in me. 


My original diagnosis was based on three things: first, a change in vision. Then an MRI where they found 20-30 lesions, then a lower lumbar puncture to confirm my immune system was attacking me. I was placed on tysabri and given one-two MRIs per year since 2015. However, the head doctor of the largest multiple sclerosis center closest to me was reluctant to diagnosis me until the lumbar puncture because he believed several of my other symptoms were indicative of severe reactions to an ssri I was on, and as I continued to go to them with symptoms, he continued to iterate that. I had several exacerbations over the years and an MRI following each one, and each MRI came back the same with no new lesions. My vision issues actually continued (the exacerbations) despite there being no progress on lesions, and over time it became apparent to me that we were all, including me, overlooking something else- I have terrible eye contact habits and was suffering from inner eye infections so once I began to get treated for those, my vision problems became preventable. It takes years to taper off of the ssri safely, which I did, and its been several years since Ive been on it. It was explained to me that the ssri changed the environment in my stomach which changed the way my immune system responded, causing an immune system disorder but not real autoimmunity. I do have another lower lumbar puncture coming up to confirm my immune system response. Perhaps Im over-excited until then, but being told by doctors that it was because of the ssri and a resulting immune system disorder because it changed the biome in my gut has been eye-opening.",claim,"As it was explained to me by my doctor, serotonin is used between immune system cells to communicate and activate immune system responses within the body.

First off- this sub has been so helpful in getting me educated on this.  You guys are awesome.

So about 2 weeks ago, I was at scout camp with my kid for the week with what I thought was tendinitis.  It was supposed to be a relaxing week for me to hike, and fish etc  while my kid worked on his merit badges.  Instead I was trapped in my tent for a week in crippling pain with what I know now was a gout attack.  

Initially my toe was a bit swollen.  Had I known it was gout, I could have avoided the food at the mess hall all week: red meat non stop among other just bad food choices.  I also ended up decreasing my water intake as I was stuck in a tent, and getting up and out to pee was extremely challenging.  You can guess what happened by the end of the week.  My entire foot was swollen.  Levels of swelling I'd never seen before...Fred Flintstone level foot.  I was in agony.

When I got home I ran to urgent care thinking I needed a brace.  I got the gout diagnosis, and was sent home on prednisone and colchicine.  I've since been eating clean, avoiding red meat/shellfish, and drinking a gallon of water a day.  I took my last Prednisone this past Sunday and my foot looks great.  The swelling is gone in my foot overall, however, my foot still feels crampy after all that trauma.  Yesterday,  I tried my sneakers on and I was surprised at how painful it was.  It wasn't the attack type of pain, but it hurt.

Hi! Just went to my doctor today. He gave me a prescription for allo, but when I told him about my concerns over flare ups when starting allo he was quite dismissive and said that wouldn't happen.

Well, it does. And in the excellent seminar by Dr. William Martin from UCLA Health he mentions putting patients on a six month regiment of either NSAIDs or colchicine (don't remember which) to prevent flare ups while reducing serum UA levels.

I found myself venting to my journal and thought I'd share. If you're feeling this way, you're not alone.

&#x200B;

I know that Im not supposed to let MS take my joy like its taken so much else, but here I am. The frustrating thing is that the change is so slight to outsiders, even to me. But the changes are still there. Its this constant cloud hanging over me, like how every time I wake up and feel a scratch in the back of my throat I remember that even though I got a positive COVID test back three weeks ago, my body still hasnt completely recovered because Im immunocompromised. If I feel extra fatigued after a long day, I start rifling through my activities, wondering what could have possibly made my legs so sore, and then I remember that sometimes just going through a day makes me stiff and sore like Id done a rigorous exercise. That swallowing thing is a real bitch, too. People dont realize how alarming it is to expect your throat to just do what it always does and send the food back and down your gullet only for there to be no motion, and for the act of swallowing to become mechanical, like writing out specific instructions to your throat on how to do its job. But really, its not about the swallowing, or the night sweats, or being constantly sick, or the tingling and the numbness, or the fatigue. Its about the degeneration. Its about the fact that every time I show a symptom, Im reminded that my body has attacked that delicate myelin sheath around my nerves and that that process will continue, even if its slowed down by Ocrevus. How am I supposed to ever be okay with that?

Mom said that someday the treatments wont be so hard on me emotionally. She says it to make me feel better because she doesnt like to see anyone in pain. It doesnt help.

And the most difficult part of this whole thing is that nothing helps. Truly. Im beyond grateful for my doctors and the treatments and everything, but Im so sick of what all these people do to try to make me feel better about it. The constant flow of, its such a different disease, and but youll still have a future, and at least they caught it early sometimes makes me just want to scream.

144,svr3gm,t5_2s23e,"New MS Diagnosis and Pregnancy
About 11 weeks into my pregnancy I started experiencing tingling/numbness on my left side and went into the doctor, thinking it was pregnancy related. They sent me to the ER to have imaging done, where they found lesions in my brain. I had a lumbar puncture done that confirmed an MS diagnosis, as well as additional MRIs on my spine that were inconclusive because they can't use contrast when you're pregnant.

My neurologist recommended I start Copaxone, but my OB doesn't want me to start it during pregnancy so I am holding off for now (with neurologist's okay). Every doctor I've seen tells me MS goes into remission/goes away during pregnancy, which has not been reassuring as I received my diagnosis in pregnancy. My flare ups have been manageable and the pain is limited. I'm actually flare up free currently (finally) which gives me hope that it is subsiding the more pregnant I get (currently 24 weeks).

I kind of just needed to vent, because adjusting to this diagnosis has been hard. There is so much uncertainty ahead and that scares me. 

I also wanted to ask if anyone has had experience breastfeeding while on Copaxone. I had planned on starting it after delivery, but my OB posed the question of if it's safe to take while breastfeeding (which I hadn't even thought about). I am waiting for my referral to an MS specialist, but I know there isn't a lot of research on the topic. Did anyone breastfeed on Copaxone? 

I'm also nervous about future pregnancies. This is our first and my husband and I want three kids, but now I'm not sure what is feasible - i.e. going off of MS meds if/when I try to get pregnant, what that might do to my body. I know my specialist will be able to ease some of these questions, but they have been weighing so heavily on me I wanted to see if anyone here has experience with this. I also know it's different for everyone, especially because I don't know what my body will be like/be capable of after pregnancy.

Sorry for the ridiculous title, but that's basically what's happened.

Here's my old post for context
https://www.reddit.com/r/MultipleSclerosis/comments/pz4q4o/no_treatment/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share 

3 months ago the Dr told me I didn't need treatment unless I was having frequent relapses. After getting advice from you guys I called the hospital I'm at and spoke to a nurse about getting treatment, because that seemed wrong. It was a no from her as well. 

So I thought I'd wait it out for 3 months until I get to my appointment with the neuro next week. Where I'd push for treatment (as would my partner) - and if it was still a no then I'd find a new Dr. 

So what happened 3 days ago? I lost feeling in my right arm 

Still hasn't come back, and now it feels like it's full of freezing cold water which is horribly uncomfortable. The sensation of temperature in my arm is so messed up, hot things feel vaguely warm and anything slightly cold feels painfully cold - like a block of ice. 

I am currently awake at 2am because its just so uncomfortable. 

So right now I don't know whether to laugh or cry. I'm absolutely furious that this has been allowed to happen and I'm scared about how long I'll be dealing with this horrible feeling. But there's also a part of me that finds it slightly funny... Is that crazy? I mean, I work on a computer all day and I can't even feel the keys??

I'm genuinely anticipating going into my appointment and having him say I'm totally fine/it's anxiety/I don't need treatment/deal with it etc. In which case I'll hit him with my stick and find someone new. 

Anyway, just wanted to vent. I only got diagnosed 6 months ago and I am already absolutely fucking done with this illness and fucking done trying to fight for every scrap of support. (Oh- still haven't had a single physio session after losing feeling from the chest down 6 months ago, and have taught myself to walk again- slowly and painfully, after leaving the hospital with nothing and buying my mobility aids from Amazon)

Ps- I'm in the UK if that's at all relevant. I've been told you have to meet quite strict criteria to be eligible for treatment, which as of yet, I apparently haven't.

UPDATE-
Gone to the walk in centre to get steroids because I can't feel my arm. They told me that if it's just sensory I need to deal with it and they aren't going to give me any treatment.

A prime minister playing king, a therapist posturing as a mans great counselor. These altered states of mind and social roles are nothing more than imaginations, not so severe as a mentally-ill person on a sleepless, 3-day bender with mania but nevertheless.

Also, if you feel youre being watched, you may be: post-9/11, there are cameras everywhere.

Like most, the worst attacks were in the beginning while starting allopurinol; Utterly debilitating and unable to walk. The intensity of the attacks went down over time, I usually am symptom free now for months at a time with an occasional mini flare. 

Some odd things Ive noticed:
-

- sometimes if I have/had an attack it will start in 1 part of 1 of my feet. It will then migrate around my foot then eventually subside and move to my other foot

- sometimes it seems that other injuries or illnesses can trigger an attack. E.g. I got the flue and near the end of my flue symptoms a gout attack started, or on several occasions Id have a gout attack after getting another injury in my foot, (strained a muscle on the bottom of my foot when then led to an attack) 

All in all, Im lucky to have the life I have but damn, do flare ups suck.  Im in one now after the flue. Just wanted to share some thoughts.

I wish you all the best. And have a great day !",claim,sometimes it seems that other injuries or illnesses can trigger an attack,640,712,73,(S (ADVP (RB sometimes)) (NP (PRP it)) (VP (VBZ seems) (SBAR (IN that) (S (NP (JJ other) (NNS injuries) (CC or) (NNS illnesses)) (VP (MD can) (VP (VB trigger) (NP (DT an) (NN attack)))))))),S,1

Hey yall I used to be in the same boat. Every puff of thc would get me into a full blown psychosis that lasts roughly about 48-72 hrs. I suffer with bipolar 2 and these weed psychosis didnt always start off like that. It started off as predrome psychosis exclusively from THC withdrawl. Because of the sudden absence of THC affecting dopamine levels. This started happening at the age of 16. I could smoke weed but for some reason couldnt quit . Then at age 20 full blown psychosis starts occurring during and after weed consumption. Psychosis lasted about 48-72hrs. The only cure for this issue is literally taking your Anti psychotics and wait them to take FULL effect up to 6 weeks to see results. Now I literally smoke like a champ. 95% thc distillate to the face every 3 hours and have not suffer psychosis in the last 8 months even if I withdrawal from weed. The medication that absolutely removed all this nonsense was called seroquel 300 XR. The power of anti psychotics is amazing that it even creates a barrier between THC. So remember take your meds!

M/45/not overweight, generally active.  So I have had gout and been on Allo for a couple of years.  Untreated my UA was over 9, then on 200 mg it was down to 6.4, so my Dr recently upped it to 300 mg.

I am now living in a cold country and sleeping on a shitty mattress, and my toes are fine, but I'm getting pain in my shoulders. There is no pain in normal sitting position, but its painful (in shoulder joint) to scratch my back, or to try to raise my arms above a certain level or to push my self up to a sitting position from lying down. Both arms, slightly different mobility range in each. The range of mobility without pain can vary week-to-week.

I thought it was a physical injury for ages (a sprain from stopping myself falling), but it never went away in months and I eventually realised the pain is exactly like the gout, but its in both my shoulders, not in my toes.

I've further realised today, that its pretty much in the same parts of my shoulders (joint tops) that get slightly exposed (and very cold) when the duvet slips down a bit at night.

Anyone have any experience of anything similar? What did you do about it?

Hey guys, I'm hoping for some advice or stories here. 

My boyfriend was diagnosed at ~15 years old and is now 23. I am 22 and bought a house across the country. We are looking to move there, but I cannot solely provide for him should he be unable to find employment. 

COVID has been hard enough on job opportunities, but he has over a year gap in his resume and has been working part time retail jobs more recently. However, he feels like he might have a seizure now and then and this means he leaves work early. I fear they are cutting his hours because they don't see him as reliable. 

He's only had about one grand mal seizure every ~3 months, and that's because he listens to his body and rests when he needs to. 

Because of this, it looks like he doesn't qualify for federal disability benefits. They're not frequent enough, but his employers will continue to fire/cut hours until he's basically shadow-fired. 

What programs are there to help find employment? He's interested in IT, working from home at any capacity, or anything without too much physical labor. 

Are there any programs to give him a disability status that can be used to leverage more sick days at work?

If so, does it completely bar him from holding a driver's license? His seizures are well managed, but the dosages/meds he has needs tweaking since weight gain. He has gone almost a year before without seizures when he was thinner, so I'm hoping we can try and keep his rights to a license.

I have been to a lot of doctors in the last year and a half. Someone (not a doctor) had suggested to me to make an appointment with a rheumatologist. But I wonder whether I should really do this if I am not in the midst of a flare up (of whatever it is I have). Because that's when blood tests would turn out with important information, right?

When this happens I also feel extremely fatigued, like I am going to get sick with the flu, my body feels heavy and aches. And my chest hurts sharply when I inhale.

189,rxkvdb,t5_2syer,"My Journey with Gout (Or why I answer posts the way I do) (long read)
Does this story sound familiar?  

I woke up one day thinking I twisted my ankle while sleeping.  It was the ankle I broke when I was a kid so I figured I re-injured it somehow while tossing and turning.  Walked gingerly and wore a brace for a week until it felt better.  A year later - the same thing.  Woke up and felt like I twisted my ankle while sleeping.  Same thing - walked gingerly and wore a brace.  Then it started happening more often.  

Finally my wife says - she thinks it might be gout.  I go see my General Practitioner - after a blood test - lo and behold UA levels of 8 mg/dL.  Gives me a prescription of 100mg of Allopurinol, Colchicine and 50mg of  Indomethacin.  Take the Colchicine and Indomethacin - pain goes away.  Think nothing of it.  Skip on the Allo because I don't want to be on life long medication.

4 years since my first gout attack - Now every year around Thanksgiving to New Years I get a gout attack because of all the rich food I ingest.  I keep around Indomethacin as colchicine no longer seems to work for me.  The rest of the time I don't really have a problem.

6 years since my first gout attack - I start getting gout attacks in random places.  Elbow, knee, wrist, top of foot, bottom of foot, Achilles.  Gout attacks start happening 2 -3 times a year.  Now I need prednisone to start dealing with the pain.  I have prednisone and indomethacin laying around the house just in case.  I try to ""eat right"" - I lose a little weight.  I no longer drink.  I find that gluten is a major trigger for me and go gluten free.  

9 years since my first gout attack - I've missed going to events because I can barely walk.  I have a cane in every room to help me hobble around.  Not only is my diet changed but I've tried every supplement out there.  Tart cherry juice, tart cherry extract, apple cider vinegar, random gout pills from amazon.  I finally have enough and ask to see a specialist.  

10 years from my first gout attack and my first Rheumatologist  visit.  My Blood serum UA levels are at 10mg/dL.  I get sent for X-rays to see if there is any joint damage.  Start at 300 mg of allopurinol. and 25mg daily indomethacin.  Go back in a month to get blood tests.  1 month later my serum levels are at 8mg/dL.  Get another 300mg of allopurinol for a total of 600mg.  1 month later my serum levels are at 5.5mg/dL.  Add 100mg for a total of 700mg of allopurinol.  1 month later my serum levels are at 5mg/dL.  Negotiate with the doc to go back to 600mg - so that I only have to have 1 prescription filled - otherwise I needed the 300mg dose and the 100mg dose both filled.

6 months after holding at 5.5mg/dL and daily low level indomethacin - I have 4 pieces of pepperoni pizza.  Next day a bad gout attack.  Take high level dose 50mg of indomethacin 3x daily until the flare goes away.  Maybe 3 days of pain.  This is my last gout attack!

5 years after being on allopurinol - taken daily religiously with my vitamins - no pain, no mobility issues.  COVID vaccine taken - no gout flares.  Why? no my crystals. 

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There seem to be several replies of late that tend to imply that some of us on this forum think UA lowering medication is the only answer.  Although it may not be the only answer - it is one that is medically proven to actually affect the real trigger of gout - monosodium urate crystals.  If you are on here often you will see me post a link to this article - ""Why does a gout attack stop""

[https://rmdopen.bmj.com/content/1/Suppl\_1/e000046](https://rmdopen.bmj.com/content/1/Suppl_1/e000046)

And I post this often because I was under the illusion that somehow MSU crystals came and went with an attack.  IE I get an attack because I formed crystals.  Then the attack went away so the crystals went away.  Understanding that stopping the flare does not mean the crystals went away is the key point I try to make to everyone.  Anecdotally - if you look at my story - really what was happening to me is my UA levels kept going up and crystals started forming all over my joints. (Hence the attacks at various parts of my body). The crystals were still there - even with my serum UA levels below 6mg/dL for 6 months.  That is why I flared when I ate my trigger food.  Crystals still didn't finish dissolving even after 6 months of ""normal UA levels"".  

What does that mean for diet?  I would change the word to lifestyle change.  You basically have to keep eating for the rest of your life - food that would keep your UA levels below 6 mg/dL so that crystals can dissolve and so that you won't form new crystals.  Also you might still flare while those crystals dissolve.  Any other diet is just dealing with the inflammation not with the MSU crystals.  You'd need to monitor your UA levels so that you know you are keeping it low.  And obviously it isn't super easy to dissolve crystals - 6 months for me - and I've read about some people in the year(s) range and still having flares.  

So please understand where I am coming from.  I am one of you.  I suffered with this for a long time thinking I could manage it.  I didn't want to take life long medication.  Maybe you can manage it - and please come back here and tell us what you are doing if you find it helpful.  I am not against alternative treatment.  What I am trying to do is spread a better understanding of the disease and hopefully some of you won't have to suffer for 10 years before seeking help.",claim,she thinks it might be gout,544,570,27,(S (NP (PRP she)) (VP (VBZ thinks) (SBAR (S (NP (PRP it)) (VP (MD might) (VP (VB be) (NP (NN gout)))))))),S,1

193,p7j49y,t5_2syer,"Crazy amount of sardines caused gout (possibly cured?)
Hello! Throughout the last 1.5 years I've been eating maybe 2 cans of sardines a day on average. I realize this sounds crazy but almost everything I read showed that sardines are like salmon but without the mercury and there were even articles saying daily consumption of sardines is safe. A few months ago I had a minor gout attack (very small amount of pain) and didn't realize what it was. Then I had a much worse one 2 months later, realized what it was, went on NSAIDS etc. The pain went away almost immediately from NSAIDs, literally in 10h maybe (at least it went to 1% of what it was) the swelling went down but stayed a bit and never really went away. A few weeks later I went to the beach, had some champagne and lobster (I had read lobster wasn't so high in purines, less than chicken) [https://elevatehealthaz.com/wp-content/Purine%20Table.pdf](https://elevatehealthaz.com/wp-content/Purine%20Table.pdf) and hoped that this wouldn't do anything. I also went on a hike the next day. The day after that I got another gout attack (worse than first, not as bad as second). 

I have totally cut out sardines and pretty much all meat from my diet, I've never really had any sugar in my diet except through fruit, I follow a very strict diet 99% of the time (except when celebrating). Pretty much just oatmeal, eggs, kale, avocados, etc). 

I have read that gout can't be cured, that it's caused by a number of factors outside of diet including kidneys unable to flush uric acid quickly enough, enzymes in body from genetics producing too much uric acid, autoimmune and inflammation issues etc. I have had my kidneys tested and they flush uric acid at a normal rate, I have had my chronic inflammation levels tested (through c reactive protein liver tests) and it is normal as well. I also have had my uric acid tested at 7.9 (months after cutting out sardines). 

It seems completely reasonable that gout could be caused temporarily by a huge amount of purines and uric acid (like if you injected yourself with uric acid and got your rate to 20 or 30 for example, physically it seems like it would ALWAYS crystalize at high enough levels. For this reason (not necessarily arguing that it's true in my case) it seems like gout could be cured in some cases by lowering uric acid levels (only in people who would never get it normally and had some action that caused a huge amount of abnormal build up like eating 2-3 cans of sardines a day). 

However, I have not read anything about gout being ""cured"" and this sub seems to mainly say that diet actually has a limited impact and rarely helps (most people seem to recommend allopurinol).

Hi guys. I was just reading posts on here and decided I wanted to pop on here and ask about CFLD (Cystic Fibrosis associated Liver Disease). 
So, I was diagnosed with CFLD around 2007, but we (me and my mom) actually didn't know this wasn't a normal part of CF that every CF'er has.(Because apparently, only 8% have it...?)

We found out that it isn't that normal just a couple of weeks ago. So, for those of you who also have CFLD, I was wondering what's it like for you? Does it make you feel sicker? Have you had hospitalisations for CFLD complications alone? Have some of you maybe even had a liver transplant? What does treatment look like for you?

Also, on my latest abdominal echo scan thingy, they noticed my spleen was slightly enlarged,, 13 cm. This isn't drastic, but it still leaves me with questions. What does this mean? How fast can it deteriorate? What treatment is there? What further complications could this cause?

198,rre6wn,t5_2qlaa,"New to this.. GERD, LPR, Hiatus hernia cocktail
Hi there! 

Sorry for the long story:

After 4 years of struggle, I was finally diagnosed with hiatus hernia (grade A) and esofagitis. I also have a horrible cough that has been going on for the past 3 years and has been happening increasingly more often, to the point where now it's almost every day. I'm scared of being stuck with any permanent damage to my throat or lungs..

Basically it all started 4 years ago with my heart fluttering/beating hard after every meal. I was prescribed xanax without even having checked my heart.. even though i never had any anxiety problems. For 6 months I took xanax and had the same symptoms, so all the doctors told me to 'just chill, you're stressing too much'. Then a cough started, always at night, lasting between 1-3 hours, i thought it was the smoking so i reduced the cigarettes but it still happened. The doctor did an xray said my lungs are fine and just to stop smoking, but even stopping smoking didn't fix it. It used to happen every few months, then every month, and now every week, almost every single day for the past 10 days. 

The pills don't work, the diet doesn't work, I'm just losing hope in everything, and everything my doctor can say is well, you just have to take omeprazol twice a day for the rest of your life. I'm 31, I don't want to take any pills every day for the rest of my life, especially not one that can damage my kidneys or cause osteoporosis. 

I'm down to a very light decaf coffee a day with a lot of no dairy milk, I'm staying away from sweets such as chocolate, fried and greasy foods. I took omeprazol for the past 3 months, with little to no relief. I quit it for 2 weeks and immediately felt better, only for it to start again right after the endoscopy, so now i'm back on it. 

If you have any tips, any tips at all for living with this or making it more bearable, please do share, because I feel like i'm going up the walls, like I'm only a shell of myself. How do you deal with this?

Sorry but I've recently been walking everyday for my arthritis and fibro, and noticed when I sit down and chill after, I get a tight and weak chest and my back and chest and ribs ache (basically my whole body aches) and I get tired and slightly dizzy.

&#x200B;

Details about me:

Male, 5'9, 180lbs, active lifestyle, casual drinker, healthy diet

Been lurking around reading all the recommendations from you guys. Very appreciative of the tips.

Have some questions for anyone out there who is able to help.

Was feeling foot pain and my family doctor refereed me to a podiatrist who stated it's most likely gout.  I initially thought it was a bunion. Got x-rays and blood work done. X-rays negative for arthritis or broken bones but blood work showed my results as, A538. Reference range should be 150-430.

Flare ups  come and go and last approximately 2-3 days.  I took 2 weeks off work and that really helped relieve pressure on the foot. I went back into work this week and on the third day back, it started to flare up again. I'm required to wear ankle high boots at work and i'm wondering if that may be a factor for the flare ups?

&#x200B;

So few questions,

&#x200B;

1) Are the work boots a factor? Does anyone else have a similar experience?

2) Based off the blood work results of 538 and the maximum range is 430. What steps should I be taking to help lower that number?

3) Based off what i've read, it sounds like allopurinol seems to be helpful so I plan on contacting my family doctor for a prescription for that.",claim,"off what i've read, it sounds like allopurinol seems to be helpful so I plan on contacting my family doctor for a pr",1168,1283,116,"(S (PP (IN off) (SBAR (WHNP (WP what)) (S (NP (PRP i)) (VP (VBP 've) (VP (VBN read)))))) (, ,) (S (NP (PRP it)) (VP (VBZ sounds) (SBAR (IN like) (S (NP (NN allopurinol)) (VP (VBZ seems) (S (VP (TO to) (VP (VB be) (ADJP (JJ helpful)))))))))) (IN so) (S (NP (PRP I)) (VP (VBP plan) (PP (IN on) (S (VP (VBG contacting) (NP (PRP$ my) (NN family) (NN doctor)) (PP (IN for) (NP (DT a) (NN pr)))))))))",S,1
202,rs3587,t5_2s1h9,"I'm losing my mind. Do I go to the neuro or the Psych???
TL;DR: Epilepsy since 7/21. On trileptal. Also have ADHD. My emotional outbursts/episodes/panic attacks have increased and become severe. Also all ADHD symptoms are multiplied by 100. Exec function, memory, attentiveness... nonexistent. To the point of affecting life. Does my neuro or psych help first?? (I have upcoming appointments with both)


I have pretty severe ADHD (34, F). I have been diagnosed my entire life. I have been able to manage myself VERY well my entire adult life without medication. Even with my career. I do have sensory and mood issues too, but I have been great at managing them and realizing what's triggers them. 

I had my first and only nocturnal TC seizure 7/27/21. With like 10 days prior to that where I woke up insanely sweaty and nauseous and out of it (my neuro said it's likely I had a lot of partial seizures). I am immediately put on Oxcarbazapine (trileptal) because of the number of events I had. I do have recurring partial seizures/auras monthly still.

Here is what's happening to me. 

Since seizure and starting trileptal, my mood and emotional state were the first thing I noticed. I would get overstimulated way easier and it would put me into severe crying episodes, couldn't stop myself, and had to call into work. I would start off irritated, it would turn to almost rage, then into bawling. They happened a couple days, then I felt normal for a while. Now I have noticed that it happens just periodically. If I had to estimate, maybe 3-4 days a month? I also feel exhausted the next day after this. 

Last night, it happened again after a very minor argument with my husband. Irritated first from being overstimulated, then a short rage where I said ""just shut up""to him. This is a big deal because I've NEVER said ""shut up"" to him, ever, in 6 years. Then I snapped out of the anger, got scared that I acted like that, and had a severe panicking cry episode. It made me write this. 

 Memory is SO bad I am even having trouble remembering if I took my trileptal after I have had it in my hand. Or, my pill alarm goes off, I'm busy, I have forgotten within 5 minutes until the second alarm goes off. I have 3 alarms and still take them late sometimes. This is the easiest example, but the memory is SO BAD I can't even think of any more examples at the moment. 

Getting interrupted when I am focused on something is usually a minor inconvenience, but now, it's like I am completely thrown off and am lost. Like a child.  My husband asked me ""I thought you were going to do ___"" And it threw off my imagined ""routine"" so bad that whatever focus I had on cleaning was gone and I was instantly lost, recalculating, bit failing to get back on track. 

Last- overstimulation. Crowds used to be just uncomfortable for me. Now I can't hardly be in them. Lights hurt, sounds are amplified, anxiety skyrockets. Textures bother me more than before. Severely. Basically, all the things that ""bothered"" me before are amplified and make me want to crawl out of my skin. 

Writing this out, I feel so ridiculous, but I am hoping someone out there understands what I'm trying to say and maybe it resonates with them too. This has all been since my seizure.

208,ozw25v,t5_2syer,"I made gout soup today!
As a scientist and gout sufferer, I wanted to combine high anti-inflammatory and uric acid lowering foods in a soup. I started with the essential ingredients with scientific proven benefits and during the making I added extra super-healthy ingredients to the soup. I am a vegetarian since I suffer from gout, so no meat will be used in this recipe.

***Important note***:I do believe in the power of healthy food, as they contain active compounds, which have been proven to have real health benefits. However, I want to make clear that this recipe is NOT a substitute for gout medication. Allopurinol is a powerful drug which can bring your uric acid serum levels down, and colchicine is a great alkaloid to stop or reduce the pain of a gout attack. This soup may help your gout but this recipe is especially just a very healthy soup with ingredients that may lower uric acid levels and may have anti-inflammatory effects. Effects are proven in vitro or in vivo and not always in humans. I just wanted to do this as a little experiment for fun.

Base ingredients:

* 600 grams of celery root
* 400 grams of celery
* 10 grams of turmeric
* 10 grams of curry powder
* 5 grams of black pepper
* One ginger root
* Two cloves of garlic
* 2,5 liters of water
* 30 mL of sunflower oil for sautéing

\*\*Method (Part I)\*\*I heated the oil in a large pot, added garlic, ginger and spices to the mix and sautéd for a short period. I then added cubes of celery root, pieces of celery to the pot. After few minutes of sautéing, I added the 2,5 liters of water. I cooked to a broth for nearly 45 minutes.

**Taste test**Not really yummy as expected, so I started improvising and added a few ingredients:

* More pepper, curry powder, salt and 8 bay laurel leaves
* About 5 to 8 grams of cayenne pepper: the spiciness gives a psychological detox feel :)
* 450 grams of broccoli (frozen)

Cayenne pepper has anti-inflammatory properties

\*\*Method (Part II)\*\*Added extra ingredients to the large pot and cooked for another 15 minutes. After almost forgetting to remove the laurel leaves, I mixed everything until a smooth green liquid.

Once the MRI is done, how long have most waited for a diagnosis? Immediately, weeks, months?

Long story short, after 6+ months of some episodes (two periods of consisting of several weeks of stabbing pains and bruise like aches, tightness, band feeling on extremities and chest, muscle twitches) I was referred to a Neuro. My appointment was scheduled last Thursday and was set for a month out, but I work for the healthcare chain and know more about our services than some others and after talking with the nurse, wound up with an appointment today with a different facility via telehealth. After looking at my labs, my neuro said everything looked normal besides a few being borderline low, so recommended retesting. Negative Lupis, RA, thyroid etc. He said my symptoms are more inline with a deficiency of some sort but labs were fine and he didnt like that I had fascinations, especially in the face, or leg tremors when holding them up as instructed. Thats when he mentioned MS as a possibility and has ordered an MRI of the brain and spine.

Im grateful I was able to have an appointment with a neurologist so quickly, and one that was surprisingly thorough. Im aware that this could be caused by something completely other than MS, but it has been something at the back of mind. I just turned 31, so Im a bit anxious and nervous but ready for answers.

Hi all. Semi frequent lurker. First time poster.

Im on about day 6 of a flare up in my big toe. This is year three of me having a flare up around the same time of year (sometime in the winter). Ive never been prescribed anything besides NSAIDs but have been taking a tapering dose of prednisone that my mother in law had in reserve (former nurse). 

This flare up is particularly frustrating because in the last year, Ive made major positive changes in my lifestyle. I went on noom, lost about 65 pounds (63, current weight 237). I have been drinking minimum 80 ounces of water a day for the last year) and intensely exercise usually 5 of 7 days a week. I also have been taking a single tart cherry extract supplement every day for over a year. I drink infrequently, maybe one night on the weekend, and not that much to boot.

Ive never felt physically better until this shit hits me like a brick.

Part of the reason I decided to make these changes was because of my first gout attack 3 years ago. Absolutely miserable experience. My dad has a history of it but I thought Id at least get a few years more before it effected me (currently 31 years old). Hes been on Allo but has never decided to lose his own weight. 

I have another doctors appointment on Friday where theyre planning to test UA levels and do a kidney analysis. 

My question is, because this seems to be a yearly thing and not as frequent an occurrence as some others in this sub have unfortunately experienced, should I bite the bullet and just demand allo? Or should I just keep a stash of prednisone on me for flare ups (even though it hasnt done much for me for this attack)?

This last attack has seemed to last longer than the others but hasnt been as acutely painful.

227,ss929k,t5_2saq9,"What tests do I need?
Sorry for the long post but hoping for some advice. I've been having what I think are symptoms of POTS since I had covid last summer, high jump in heart rate on standing up (goes from 75 resting to 130 just on standing up and walking downstairs, and stays high while I'm standing), headaches, fatigue, tinnitus etc. In the UK, you get referred to a ""post covid clinic"" where they decide via telephone appointment what tests/referrals you need, and I was only referred to go for a ""lying to standing blood pressure"" test which was done today.

The nurse didn't seem to have a clue what was needed. She asked if I wanted to lie down or stand first(???), then got me to lay down and immediately took my blood pressure. I was laid down less than 2 minute before she asked me to stand and immediately took blood pressure again, once. It didn't feel like there was any time for my body to adjust to the change in position before any readings were taken. Both were normal, but she didn't look at my heart rate at all, even when I mentioned it was racing. 

As it stands, this result will go back to the post covid nurse who will review it in 6-8 weeks, but I'm not sure that what was done today will show anything at all. Are there particular tests that I should be pushing for that will confirm or negate that this is POTS? I do have the option of using private health cover, but need to know what type of specialist I need, and what type of tests I am asking for. I find it much easier to be assertive with medical professionals if I know what I actually want them to do.

 A research team led by Dr. Marcus Koch and Dr. Wee Yong (Co-Founder and Chief Scientific Officer of AnthoBio) at the University of Calgary that investigates a generic drug, hydroxychloroquine, in primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) recently published its clinical study results in Annals of Neurology. The study followed 35 PPMS patients over a period of five years. Throughout the study, 14 patients were expected to develop a significant reduction in their walking function. However, only 8 patients had experienced a reduction by the end of the study. Thats almost a 50% reduction in the number of PPMS patients negatively affected by continuing disability. Although the results will require confirmation in a larger trial, this study has shown that hydroxychloroquine could help slow down the disability progression of PPMS. This study opens the possibility for future treatment option for PPMS and the researchers hope their work will inspire future larger scale clinical research on the drug for PPMS.

235,qm36j3,t5_2syer,"my home testing results
Possible inaccuracies notwithstanding, my home testing has suggested a general downward trend in my UA. I started testing in late September after having 2 flares in September. At the same time I completely quit all of my known triggers (salmon, trout) and my possible triggers (seafood, pie) and in fact all animal flesh protein. I already hadn't had a drink since early August (wasn't  a heavy drinker but did like a shot or two of rum most nights). Getting my protein from eggs, nuts and dairy and probably a few other  non-meat things now.  Drinking more milk and a little tart cherry juice most days. Over the last couple weeks I have added wine back in, and that hasn't seemed to affect my UA at all. 

 Since I was flaring much of September my initial readings may have been lower than my normal, but we'll never know. What I do know is

Over the first 2 weeks I averaged 6.9 and a lab test October 4 came back at 6.9

Over the 28 days I averaged 6.5. 

Over the last 2 weeks I averaged 6.1

And today the lab tested me at 6.2. So I seem to have dropped 0.7 mg/dl in 28 days, assuming they are spot-on. (I think they are supposed to be within 0.2)

So despite the limitations of the meter, which I can't seem to rely on for a daily reading, it does seem to mirror the lab results when its all averaged out over longer time frames. The downward trend I seemed to be seeing seems to have been real. 

My big toe is still sore off and on, and I'm having a cortisone injection tomorrow. Its possible I have lasting damage there; my first flare was in March 2017.

250,stkk63,t5_2syer,"High Frequency Treatment & Gout
So I've been a gout sufferer for few years and I know my triggers: beer & regular soda with sugar. And it always attacks my ankle and knee. 

Few weeks ago it was a stressful day at work on Friday and I opened the fridge without thinking and grabbed a can of Coke Zero and drank it in one gulp but in reality it was regular Coke.

Sure enough, the next morning I was feeling the tingling sensation. We happen to have the family Zoom call and my MIL who lives in Korea hears that I am suffering from gout. She tells me that she will send us something that's good for gout and I don't think much of it. By Sunday morning, I was having a full blown gout attack and my right ankle is stiff as hell. 

A package arrives on following Wed from Korea and it was this weird looking machine that looks like a foot massager. As I am reading the manual, it sounds like a total snake oil. It talks about how cancer happens more often to those that have lower body temperature and raising 1 degree celsius in your core body temperature can reduce the risk of cancer by more than 50%. It also talks about how the high frequency current that's emitted from this machine creating thermal energy will make the cells in your body vibrate and help with all types of joint pains. By then I was fully convinced this was a fraud and I called me MIL and was like I ain't falling for this horseshit and told her I will be sending it  for her to get a refund. But she's adamant that I give it a try since someone else that she knows who was suffering from gout big time has been using the same machine and it has helped significantly.

So I decide to give it a try. Within a minute or two, you can feel the warmth and as times goes by, I am feeling this tiny shocks all over my feet and within 15 mins I am sweating like I ran a marathon. 

About an hour after I finish the session, I can feel the stiffness on my ankle subsiding just a little bit. I wanted to try it once again but the manual says only to do one 30 min session every 12 hours. So the next morning as soon as I woke up, I did it again and sure enough, I gained more flexibility around my ankle to the point where I was able to grab it and crack my ankle which usually is the sign that my gout is going away. This normally happens about a week after the full attack starts. But with this device, I was pain free within 48 hours and everything was back to normal. 

To test if this was not just a placebo effect, I drank 2 cans of beer few days later but it didn't cause an attack and I am afraid to try again for obvious reasons. I even sent out a message to people that I know in my area to see if anyone was suffering from gout and if so, come and try this machine to see if it actually works for them as well.  

By no means, I am trying to start a controversy or gain anything materially from this (I am not even posting anything particular about the product and googling won't help either) but anyone else has heard about high frequency thermal treatment for gout? My MIL called the manufacturer and they are claiming the high frequency thermal energy is causing the uric crystals to vibrate and they are being shaken off from the joint and going back into the bloodstream. I know high frequency treatment exists for acne but I've never heard such thing for gout.

Hi everyone!

This has been a rough go but Ill try to explain. I never had heartburn in my life until getting pregnant in 2019. Pepcid worked for me when I was pregnant but it stopped working a couple months postpartum. 
I started taking omeprazole 20 Dec 2019 and it worked like a charm. I had no issues until February 2021 when I started getting digestive issues of stomach aches and gas. Tested positive for h pylori and Sibo which I treated with antimicrocials successfully. The naturopath doctor suggested I wean off ppis and I had been successfully taken 10mgs without symptoms for 6 weeks. I came off ppis and didnt have symptoms for 12 days and got intense burning back pain and throat pain in august.

So I got back on 20mg and this is where the yo-yo began. I tried tapering off 2 more times and failed each time needing a higher dose to manage my symptoms.

December 5th I accidently ate guacamole that had jalapeños in it and have been suffering ever since(mind you I was on nexium 40mg at the time):
Burning back pain 
Throat burning 
Clogged ears 
Voice hoarseness

Currently Ive been on 80mg of nexium since December 9th, had an endoscopy on 12/22 which was clear and negative for biopsies. I do have a 2cm sliding hiatal hernia.

Ppis
A wedge pillow
Gaviscon advance 
Pepcid before bed
Stop eating 3 hours before bed

Hello, I dont post often but stumbled upon this wonderful subreddit last night as I couldnt sleep due to the pain.

Im M/27 and overweight/heavy drinker. After getting married a few months ago I decided it was time for some changes and went to my PD for the first time in years. Had gained about 80lbs since going when I was 21 and told the doctor I had been drinking about 6/7 days. My liver enzymes were about 3 times elevated. In the weeks since then Ive lost about 10 pounds and had quit drinking on weekdays and doing moderate exercise/eating a much healthy diet(which did include a lot of chicken and fish)

About two weeks ago I woke up thinking I had broken my ankle. After suffering for a few days I went to urgent care thinking I had a blood clot or something and they told me it was gout. Prescribed me prednisone and hydrocodone. I started feeling better within a day and was pretty much back to normal by the following week. 

However I have another flare up now and cant walk again. Im trying to go to see my PD because Im not sure if I should really be taking prednisone and hydrocodone with my high liver enzymes. Ive seen a lot of talk about colchicine and allopurinal. Just wondering if anyone else has similar experiences and knows if these would be better for me.

259,sdgtxa,t5_2saq9,"Feeling confused and discouraged. Any advice on diagnosis?
Hi everyone, apologies if this ends up being really long! I have suspected I have had POTS for a while now but none of the doctors I have seen seem to really care. I have seen my family doctor and they referred me to a specialist. The specialist said the most common heart condition is SVT (supraventricular tachycardia) and slapped that diagnosis on me. He didnt really do any tests or ask about my symptoms. I went back again and said I dont think its SVT as it isnt acute 5 minute episodes, its chronic fatigue and weakness as well as high HR and intolerance to being in an upright position. He dismissed it and said you know what we never really figure out why people have these issues, they just have them and thats that. He said the fatigue is probably from the beta blockers he has me on for SVT, however its such a low dose I didnt experience any fatigue when I started them.

When I pushed that I really do think its POTS he said ok fine my medical student will do a quick test. They had me lay down on a table, immediately took me blood pressure and HR, then told me to stand, and immediately took my blood pressure and HR again and said well theres no difference in your HR or BP. Im fairly certain that isnt an accurate test for POTS but I didnt argue with them. I also have days where I feel fine and days where just standing to cook some food feels like running a marathon. Of course the day they did the test I felt fine.

I guess my question is how did you get diagnosed with POTS? What symptoms do you experience from having POTS? I also have read that POTS is usually triggered by an accident or severe illness, but I think its something Ive always had.

I feel discouraged from seeking further medical advice because it really doesnt seem like they care. And now Im questioning whether its actually POTS or if I just naturally have a higher HR and am fatigued all the time because of stress or anxiety.. I dont know..

Edit: I just want to add that I feel like I know very little about POTS or any other conditions that it could be.

267,sv1zw9,t5_2s3g1,"Some Info on Probiotics for IBS
So I posted this in a comment and it was suggested that I make this info its own post. I did a bunch of research into what probiotics have shown to be effective for IBS in various research studies.

From the links below, the collective summary is that these probiotic strains (alone or in combination with others) were effective in one or more studies in reducing one or more IBS symptoms in frequency and/or severity: 

Saccharomyces Boulardii CNCM I-745 (actually a yeast), Bifidobacterium longum 35624, Bifidobacterium infantis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus plantarum 299v, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Saccharomyces cerevisiae CNCM I-3856, Bifidobacterium lactis HN019, Bifidobacterium lactis BB-12, Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM, Bifidobacterium lactis Bi-07, and Bifidobacterium bifidum MIMBb75.

I may have missed a few in the above list, but the main gist is that Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus species probiotics, as well as Saccharomyces Boulardii, are the main researched probiotics that show some kind of improvement for IBS (though it also depends on the type of IBS, and most of them helped with one or some symptoms but not all of them - see links below for more detail).

Also, many of the studies couldn't draw conclusive evidence because there just wasn't enough data/research on specific probiotics yet, or because the studies didn't fulfill certain criteria. But they were able to state what evidence they did have, and identify what is likely to be the case based on findings so far.

Bifidobacterium longum 35624 used to be called Bifidobacterium infantis 35624 and is still sometimes referred to that way. It is patented by Align, which is the brand name for that probiotic. Floraster is a leading brand name for Saccharomyces Boulardii CNCM I-745. There are other good probiotic brands too though (that have similar or different probiotic strains).

A lot of this will be trial and error as you find what works for you. Be sure to give each probiotic or probiotic blend you try at least a 4 week trial, since it takes a bit of time for your body to adjust and for the probiotics to get to a certain level in your system to start working.

It's a good idea to make sure that the probiotics are third-party tested and made in a GMC (or equivalent) registerred facility, to be sure you are getting exactly what's on the product label. I'm not sure exactly how it works in other countries, and that advice is US-based, but some level of quality assurance is generally advised.

Also, for those who aren't used to reading research papers like this, usually the important information is in the Results and/or Discussion section. Sometimes they put a summary of those near the top, and sometimes you have to scroll to the end of the article. It's also a good idea to read the abstract/summary at the top of the article so you have an idea of what the paper is about. Reading the other sections of the paper will give you more detail into what they did for the study, which will give more context, but isn't usually necessary to read the whole thing to understand the end results, which tell you what they found about the probiotics in relation to IBS.

And of course, always talk to your doctor about medical stuff! I'm just providing this information in case it might be helpful. I am NOT giving medical advice or telling you all to take probiotics or endorsing any brands or types or anything. Whether you decide to take probiotics or not is up to you and your doctor. This is just an info dump in case anyone wanted to know this stuff.

268,su4pho,t5_2s23e,"Belgian Study Found No Difference Between Brain Volume Loss of MS Patients with No Disease Activity (NEDA) and Healthy Individuals
A Belgian study found no difference between brain volume loss (BVL) of healthy individuals and patients with MS (pwMS) that had no evident disease activity (no lesions), also known as NEDA-3.

Citing the article:

**NEDA-3 has recently been launched as an ambitious treatment goal in the clinical management of MS, striving for complete suppression of inflammatory disease activity. In patients who have obtained such a label, a significantly lower rate of BVL was demonstrated across the evaluation period, compared with their counterparts who did not [17,18], although the difference with normal aging has not been extensively investigated yet. Our study now shows a similar degree of whole brain and total gray matter volume decline in patients with MS, as measured between two MRI time points demarcating a period of NEDA-3, and a group of healthy volunteers who were matched for age and sex, suggesting that neurodegeneration can slow down to physiological levels once inflammatory disease activity has been silenced.**

What is NEDA-3?

The term no evidence of disease activity-3 (NEDA-3) has been introduced to identify patients receiving such DMT who are completely free from new relapses, MRI lesion accrual and clinical disability worsening. NEDA-3 is a composite measure with a possible twin significance: i.e., no detectable evidence of inflammation (as manifested by the absence of new relapses and MRI lesions) nor neurodegeneration (as deduced from the clinical stability).

These findings are in line with those from a prospective Norwegian cohort studyto our knowledge, the only other direct comparative trial in this fieldin which 57 patients with early relapsing-remitting MS were stratified into a NEDA-3 (49%) versus EDA (51%) category based on 1 year of follow-up. The authors did not find a statistically significant increase in annualized subcortical gray matter volume loss, using the freely available FreeSurfer (Charleston, MA, USA) analytical software, in the MS patients with NEDA-3, as compared with an age- and gender-matched control group.

*Our conclusions are seemingly contradicted by reports revealing considerable rates of MS patients achieving NEDA-3 to have a whole BVL above the anticipated pathological threshold of 0.4% per year [22,23,24]. However, such general cut-offs are unlikely to be applicable to all participants and a substantial portion was under a lower-efficacy platform DMT regimen (i.e., interferon  or glatiramere acetate), also illustrating the heterogeneity of studies addressing this issue.*

Anyway, Ive been in a lot of posts lately about constipation. Heres the thing: if you have IBS-C but havent had motility testing, you definitely need it. 

You could have full or partial bowel dysmotility and it be the cause of your problems. This is especially true if you dont respond to dietary changes (very high fibre) or medication (especially prescriptions). 

You need to get tested for colonic inertia (this is key). It is the first in line. There are tests to check your stomach for slow emptying (Gastroparesis), small bowel dysmotility, pelvic floor and rectal issues, as well. All of these should be in a regular work up. 

If your GI doesnt do it, you should go to a motility clinic. There are numerous but not abundant. Most teaching hospitals have one and there are directories online. You should also seek out a neurogastroenterologist.

If you have any questions about this, colonic inertia, bowel dysmotility, or my own experience, please post them here and Ill answer them all.

273,scnj08,t5_2s23e,"NEW Study Explains How Epstein-Barr Virus Infection Could Cause/Trigger MS
**Similarities between an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) protein and a brain protein called GlialCAM may explain why EBV infection increases the risk of multiple sclerosis (MS), results from a new study show.**

**Due to the structural resemblance of the two proteins, B-cells  a type of immune cell that is critical to the development of MS  might accidentally end up attacking a persons own healthy tissue while trying to fight off EBV.**

The findings begin to unravel the molecular mechanisms behind the long-known association between EBV infection and MS and may pave the way to the development of novel therapies for the neurodegenerative disease.

Results were published in Nature in the study  which was made available early due to the importance of the research.[Clonally Expanded B Cells in Multiple Sclerosis Bind EBV EBNA1 and GlialCAM,](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04432-7) which was made available early due to the importance of the research.



Epstein-Barr virus infects most people at some point in their lives. Most of the time, EBV infections dont cause noteworthy symptoms, though the virus can cause infectious mononucleosis (colloquially known as mono).

An accumulating body of research has shown a connection between EBV infection and MS. Most recently, a study of more than 10 million U.S. military members showed that infection with EBV increased the risk of developing MS by more than 30 times, placing EBV as the leading cause of MS.

*EBV may be the only risk factor required to develop MS, given essentially 100 percent of people living with MS have been infected with EBV, Lawrence Steinman, MD, a professor at Stanford University and co-author of the study, said in a press release.*

Despite this known connection, it was unclear what series of biochemical events could lead from EBV to MS.

**The new study shows that this connection may lie in immune cells called B-cells, which are best known for producing infection-fighting antibodies. A given antibody is able to bind tightly to a specific molecular target  called an antigen, which may be, for example, a piece of a virus  which triggers the immune system to attack.**

B-cells basically float around the body with antibodies primed on their surface. If their antibody binds to its antigen, the B-cell becomes activated, rapidly dividing and spewing out pro-inflammatory signaling molecules to sound the alarm to the rest of the immune system.

As an activated B-cell divides to produce more cells, the cells undergo a process called somatic hypermutation (SHM). Basically, this involves making small changes to the antibody structure that aim to increase the antibodys ability to stick to its specific antigen.



Here, scientists analyzed B-cells collected from nine patients  five with a first onset of clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) and four with a relapse of relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). From analyses of thousands of B-cells, the researchers showed evidence that many of these cells were behaving as though they were attacking an antigen.

The team then selected 148 unique B-cells from the cerebrospinal fluid (the liquid surrounding the brain and spinal cord) for further analysis, looking at the antigens that these B-cells antibodies were targeting. The team noted that six of the nine patients had B-cells that targeted an EBV protein called EBNA1, and they performed detailed structural analyses of a particular antibody, called mAb MS39p2w174, that bound to a particular region of EBNA1 referred to as AA365-425.

The scientists then noticed that the AA365-425 region of the EBNA1 protein is structurally quite similar to a part of a human protein called GlialCAM. The GlialCAM protein is expressed by certain cells in the brain, including notably oligodendrocytes  the cells chiefly responsible for producing myelin, the fatty sheath around nerve fibers that is the target of the autoimmune attack in MS.

From all these data, the researchers constructed a conceptual model for how EBV might spur the development of MS.

**First, patrolling B-cells would come in contact with the infecting virus, and some B-cells with antibodies that target the EBNA1 protein would become activated. In the course of activating, these cells undergo SHM, which could inadvertently increase the antibodys ability to target GlialCAM.**

**The antibodies then bind to GlialCAM that is expressed by healthy cells in the nervous system, which triggers the immune system to attack  ultimately leading to the development of an autoimmune disease.**

***Until now, we didnt have a step-by-step account of how this drives the immune system to attack a persons own myelin sheath. This new research fills in those gaps and provides clarity into how EBV infection can cause MS, Steinman said.***

The results imply that targeting EBV infections might be a useful strategy for treating MS  and indeed, Steinman noted, this idea is already being explored. For example, Atara Biotherapeutics is sponsoring a Phase 2 clinical trial called EMBOLD (NCT03283826) to test ATA188, an experimental therapy that aims to kill EBV-infected cells in progressive forms of MS.

***These new data further link MS to EBV-infected B cells and plasma cells, highlighting the role of EBV antigens, including EBNA1 protein, in the development of the disease, said AJ Joshi, MD, Ataras chief medical officer.***

*Importantly ATA188, Ataras investigational MS therapy, targets key epitopes of these antigens, including EBNA1, with the hope of ultimately delivering a new treatment option for the millions of people currently living with MS, Joshi added. The actively enrolling Phase 2 EMBOLD study, with a formal interim analysis planned for [the second quarter of] this year, will be a major step toward that direction.*

update: didn't end up doing the enema (tried but failed to even insert the tube 1mm), went anyways, explained the situation and ended up going through with the procedure (this is a private clinic, i pay for this out of my pocket anyways so it's not a waste of their time either way). doc told me citrafleet was milder and less effective and I should've went with moviprep instead (wish he would've told me this prior). didn't have time to explain in the post but that's just how shit works in small town eastern europe, no one cares to listen, ask questions and explain stuff to you. the reason i modified the instructions after extensive googling is because they weren't even given to me by the doc, it was a generic, confusing and vague piece of paper given to everyone at the counter (these change depending on which marketing guy visited their office last) he said only way to know if it's good is to try and see and it ended up being clean enough. he said he could tell i was being responsible about it with my diet and everything. i was watching my bowels since i wasnt sedated (uncomfy but not that bad) and there was definitely build up towards the small intestine but he vacuumed it up and the procedure was a success. found nothing other than internal hemorrhoids, told me i had elongated and kinda twisted bowels but other than that it's fine. took 4 biopsies for some micro inflammation test thing. thanks everyone for the help",claim,doc told me citrafleet was milder and less effective and I should've went with moviprep instead,970,1064,95,(S (NP (NN doc)) (VP (VBD told) (NP (PRP me)) (SBAR (S (SBAR (S (NP (NN citrafleet)) (VP (VBD was) (ADJP (ADJP (JJR milder)) (CC and) (RBR less) (JJ effective))))) (CC and) (S (NP (PRP I)) (VP (MD should) (VP (VB 've) (VP (VBN went) (PP (IN with) (NP (NN moviprep))) (ADVP (RB instead)))))))))),S,1

Hi, Im new to Reddit and to this community. I honestly need some opinions and/or advice on what to do because I cant figure out what Im experiencing. I am a 32yo Female and have been suffering from migraines since my teenage years so those are nothing new for me but maybe for the past 2+ years Ive been experiencing different kinds of migraines that now accompany severe vertigo/dizziness, constantly. I have seen an ENT and a neuro who only said my migraines are bad and nothing they be concerned about. However, 2 weeks ago I was freaked out and decided I definitely needed to do something about this when I had to pull over on my way to work. I had a vertigo episode that blurred and doubled my vision at the same time and I honestly thought I was going to get into a car accident. I pulled over and let it pass and went to work but I felt like complete crap. I had my co worker drive me to the nearest ER and after a 5 hour wait in the lobby (due to COVID surge) I was finally evaluated by a neuro team and they did say my symptoms point to possible MS. They immediately took me in for a CT and MRI scans but those scans came back normal. Blood work also normal. I was still admitted and they gave me a cocktail of meds. The last cocktail they gave me contained boric acid and prochlorpezaine which broke my headache cycle but not my dizziness. I eventually got discharged upon my request a day early because I was extremely anxious and was in a room with 6 other patients with different conditions and I couldnt do it anymore. They told me to follow up with a neuro but that neuro cant see me for another 2 months in March. Luckily, I had already made a neuro appt 3 months ago before this last episode and my appt is finally tomorrow through FaceTime. I dont want me symptoms to be dismissed. Its been 2 years and Im getting worse. Now I have this burning sensation on my left knee that I wasnt experiencing before as well as swelling of my feet and a tightness feeling. I hate googling things but I dont know much about MS and I want to become more educated.

298,sekpp9,t5_2tyg2,"How worried do I need to be about my roommates ex with violent psychosis?
Hi everyone. My friends ex-boyfriend suffered a major psychotic break and has been in and out of mental health clinics since last year. He has had violent delusions, mostly focusing on his parents, who he has accused of stealing his organs and kidnapping him and all sorts of other things, and hes expressed desire to kill his parents. My friend says that she truly believes that if hed cast her as the villain instead of his parents, shed be dead. 

She moved into a new apartment with me and another friend. According to her, he doesnt know where she lives now, and she doesnt think he has a way of finding out. Ever since his symptoms started hes been aggressive and prone to displays of violence in front of her. She has him blocked but she can still see his texts to her on her other devices since her contacts didnt update. He recently accused her of coercing him into sex their entire decade-long relationship, and now shes really scared he is going to start fixating on her. She says he has really bad follow-through (he hasnt killed his parents, obviously) and it seems like a lot of tasks are harder for him, like she had to hire a doctor to help him sell his house because she didnt think hed be able to in his current state of mind. 

She says that violent delusions are usually uncommon in people with psychosis and/or schizophrenia, and that hes in the marginal percent that unfortunately does experience this. 

I am trying to be a good friend and be sympathetic, but Im worried, too. What are the chances that hell find our apartment? Or that hell come over here and try to hurt us? He doesnt have the address, but its easy for anyone to find an address if they put their mind to it. He has guns. If he planned it all out, he could find us easily. Im just wondering if you folks with experience feeling something similar to what hes feeling know if thats the sort of thing someone suffering from a psychotic episode would be able to carry out. 

He has not respected my friends boundaries in the past or her request for him not to contact her. 

I dont experience psychosis myself, so I dont know what its like. Im hoping you folks might be able to offer me some insight into what this guy might be experiencing when he has these paranoid, violent delusions, and whether my friend and I need to be scared for our safety here.

Before he started getting violent and aggressive, he was my friend, too. I feel really bad for him. Whatever hes going through must be terrifying for him. But my first concern is if I need to be afraid OF him. If hes in the headspace to track us down and do something violent. Any advice or insight is helpful.

299,rqujl8,t5_2qlaa,"Diagnostic Tests to find the Root Cause of Acid Reflux
Hi guys,

I wanted to find out if any diagnostic tests helped find a cause for your GERD. 

I am going to the GI doctor again to figure out the root cause of acid reflux since it just doesn't make sense to me that young people with normal weights etc. can be suffering like this. I read a lot of healthy 20 years old in this reddit community that have struggled with GERD for years and years. I had a endoscope last year that showed redness in my esophagus and all the GI doctor did was hand me a prescription for PPIs, hello, we know that PPIs should not be used longer than like 6 weeks and can make the issue worse. 

Anyway, I want to know what tests to ask for at the GI doctor that may find the root cause of GERD I am going soon and I want to advocate for myself.

I've tried PPIs, gaviscon advance, magnesium supplements, probiotics, zinc carosine, DGL licorice, etc. But still am having constant chest and back pain and sore throats.

300,rqujl8,t5_2qlaa,"Diagnostic Tests to find the Root Cause of Acid Reflux
Hi guys,

I wanted to find out if any diagnostic tests helped find a cause for your GERD. 

I am going to the GI doctor again to figure out the root cause of acid reflux since it just doesn't make sense to me that young people with normal weights etc. can be suffering like this. I read a lot of healthy 20 years old in this reddit community that have struggled with GERD for years and years. I had a endoscope last year that showed redness in my esophagus and all the GI doctor did was hand me a prescription for PPIs, hello, we know that PPIs should not be used longer than like 6 weeks and can make the issue worse. 

Anyway, I want to know what tests to ask for at the GI doctor that may find the root cause of GERD I am going soon and I want to advocate for myself.

I've tried PPIs, gaviscon advance, magnesium supplements, probiotics, zinc carosine, DGL licorice, etc. But still am having constant chest and back pain and sore throats.

Has anyone gotten diagnosed with POTS and also been diagnosed with coronary disease?

- mixed a month or so ago after years of suffering (finally got the dumbest answer to all of my shit problems) anyway, I keep thinking I might have a partial bowel obstruction and its causing a great deal of anxiety.

I get super gassy, and stomach makes heaps of noises, sometimes I get nausea which isnt uncommon with my anxiety ect, please can someone tell me how Id know if I had a bowel obstruction. I visited the doc twice last month and just got told I probably have ibs, that is all, and it was great to hear after years of pain and on and off suffering, but now its been 3 months of constant suffering, worrying and all the rest and Im so over it! It honestly feels like when Im pooping and stuff is coming out that there is more in there all the time. I have read and heard a partial bowel obstruction would cause vomiting, and severe nausea and a lot more pain! And probably no passing of gas or stool!

[Structural dissociation](https://did-research.org/origin/structural_dissociation/) talks about how trauma and [emotional neglect](/r/emotionalneglect) can split a person's psyche. Emotional parts split off from the apparently normal part, and even the apparently normal part can split.

My own experiences suggest that these kinds of splits can lead to psychosis. The split off parts are not fully walled off, and especially in the right sort of triggering crisis situation, they can intrude into the experience in confusing ways. Because I didn't know those parts of myself well, and wasn't used to working with them, what happened seemed weird and partly supernatural. I wasn't used to processing that, and ended up processing it in an unreasonable way.

The difficult thing here is that when so much of myself was split off via structural dissociation, it's hard to simply ignore it.

Dr. Michelle Petri at Johns Hopkins has one of the largest lupus clinics in the world and studies her patients very very closely. She showed no increase #lupus flares after #COVID19  vaccine (228 patients) and lupus infections (31 patients tested). Anticardiolipin antibodies did increase after infection. 

Interestingly skin lupus (cutaneous lupus) tended to improve after infection.

However, antiphospholipid antibodies overall did not increase. This is important, as we know COVID infection can cause deadly blood clots (so not surprising). 

Overall, good news for lupus patients.

Dr. Michelle Petri at Johns Hopkins has one of the largest lupus clinics in the world and studies her patients very very closely. She showed no increase #lupus flares after #COVID19  vaccine (228 patients) and lupus infections (31 patients tested). Anticardiolipin antibodies did increase after infection. 

Interestingly skin lupus (cutaneous lupus) tended to improve after infection.

However, antiphospholipid antibodies overall did not increase. This is important, as we know COVID infection can cause deadly blood clots (so not surprising). 

Overall, good news for lupus patients.

she basically told me that since im not losing weight rapidly and because my blood work came back normal that there was no need to do any further testing and that we can just manage the my symptoms with medications but thats not what i want. she told me just follow the low fodmap diet and go for a walk everyday, but i already go on walks everyday and i get diarrhea and intense stomach pain no matter what i eat. ive tried eating low fodmap foods and even if i totally cut out the foods im not supposed to eat i get diarrhea. i want a doctor who is going to listen to me and actually work with me to find the source of my problems instead of just saying you have ibs, sorry cant do anything for you! 

so what i want to know is has anyone had experience taking rifaximin? how did it work for you and what were the side effects?

I started doing the Wim Hof cold showers/ ice baths and breathing about 10 months ago after a coworker recommended it. Simply because they felt amazing because of it. In his book he talks about one of the main benefits as massively reducing the amount of inflammation in the body, which is the source of all sorts of chronic disease. He briefly touches on gout but hasnt really looked into it that much.  I figured it couldnt hurt though. 

Im not taking any prescriptions but do have a supply of indomethacin that I dip into if I have a nasty flare up. I historically have 2-3 a year with 1 usually being a monster. Most will last around a week but the big boys can go 3 weeks. 

Since I started the cold showers I havent changed my diet/alcohol at all and havent had a flair up. (If I do get a tingle in my feet, its usually after a weekend of excess, but its cleared after a shower or two.) That was until yesterday, when I got hit with an attack over night that made my foot feel like it was about to split apart.  I realized I had stopped the cold showers for the last few weeks. Probably because of the weather getting much colder and it can be hard to get motivated for a cold shower in the morning. 

That  being said, I did all the normal stuff: extra water, no booze, apple cider vinegar, and ibuprofen. (I also tried nettle tea for the first time which seemed to help) but also took an extra long cold shower and one today. And its like magic. I can walk with very minimal pain and feel like I might have dodged a bullet.

342,p0y7uc,t5_2syer,"6.9 mg/dl , 31M . Should I take a second opinion?
Hi all, I am 31 years old male and recently did a general series of blood tests since I was about to leave to a remote place with poor access to medical facilities. My serum uric acid level in the test is 6.9 mg/dl. I don't have any pain like gout and I deduce this from reading posts in this community. However, I have had a slight bunion in my left foot since a couple of years. However, the pain from bunion went away once I started wearing a toe separator prescribed by an Orthopedic Physician. No pain since then. The pain comes if I don't wear the toe separator for at least a couple of days and walk around for quite some time. However, the pain only comes while walking and there is no swelling as such. I am able to bend my toe backwards. The bunion occured at a time when I was taking calcium supplements for another issue.

With the recent blood work when I went to my general physician, he asked me to take Febuxostat 40mg twice a day for 1 month, followed by once a day thereafter. This he said stating that my serum uric acid level is on the higher side. However, since the bloodwork says that the maximum value of serum uric acid is 7.0, I am confused if I should start the medication or take a second opinion.

344,soy8wt,t5_2s3g1,"Anyone else try Terbinafine 250mg tablets?
I've had IBS-D for quite a few years.  Fortunately, I found that it's likely small intestine bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) that can be managed by taking berberine with each meal (initially was 500mg per meal, but had to increase it to 1g/meal).  If I miss my berberine, then all the nasty symptoms come back in a day or two.

Recently I started taking terbinafine daily to treat toenail fungus.  This soon caused constipation, which is incredibly odd for me.  So I stop taking berberine.  Everything seems to be fine w/r bowel movements.  But I'm having a terrible time with terbinafine (headache, nausea, unable to concentrate), so I stopped taking that too on Monday.

349,qpnu0x,t5_2r876,"UPDATE: Genetic screening, 23+me, etc. My thoughts on my results...
Per my last post:
I (23, F) was born 3 months early, no idea what caused it. I've had lung issues and general health issues my entire life. The older I get, the worse my lungs get and no one seems to be able to tell me why. Tired of getting worse for no reason and feeling like no one took me seriously, I did a little research of my own. A friend of mine with CF had symptoms that closely mirrored what I've dealt with for years. So I got a 23+Me kit for fun to see what kinds of things it could tell me about my health but also my ancestry. Note: I don't know or have any relationship with my dad. So this was very helpful. 

UPDATE from last post:
  I did the 23+Me ancestry and health kit for fun and curiosity. Well... I am a Delta F508 deletion carrier. BUT the 23+Me test noted that it only covered about 30 CFTR genes and recommended that I see a genetic counselor to A. Check that the rest of my CFTR genes are okay since I'm a carrier for one, and B. Understand the risk if I choose to have children. 

OPINION: 
I am really shocked that I am even a carrier. I don't know my dad, but NO one on my mom's side even knew what CF was. So I'm not too worried about anything being wrong with the rest of my CFTR genes, but the fact that now I need to find out is a bit upsetting. As much as I want answers for my lifelong symptoms, I am a little nervous to finally get them. Sometimes ignorance is bliss. 
Also, as someone who has wanted kids for as long as I can remember, I am really saddened that now this is something I need to consider. Regardless of if my future child would have CF. It would never change the love and respect I would have for them. After all, what's one more doctor's appointment added to the schedule, ya know? But...
As pro life as I personally am, and as much as I deeply believe that EVERY life has something of value to give to the world... I am also saddened to think that my future children's suffering would be a result of my bogus DNA. Like, how crappy is that? Knowing that I am a carrier and now have a 25% chance of passing on a df508- gene, does it make me selfish that I still deeply want kids? Is it selfish to knowingly risk it? Do any of you wish your parents hadn't risked it? I dont know... just hearing other's thoughts would be nice. Thanks for listening. And thanks for the support, guys.

In early April, I thought I sprained my foot badly.

Until the next flare, and the next and the next  (none treated medically because like lots of people, I thought I could deal with it on my own).... all fairly minor until another really painful flair two weeks ago that took me a week to recover from.  However, since April, I started to aim to drink 100 oz of water a day, started daily Vitamin C supplements, took tart cherry supplements when I had little attacks, started to eat less red meat, less carbs... , etc.

Finally bit the bullet and went to see a doctor. Surprise - I somehow lost 13 lbs and had dropped my Uric Acid to 9 just by the above changes.  But I was adamant - after reading this Subreddit, I did NOT want to be one of those people who suffered for years with the pain. I wanted to start a plan of action to get my Uric Acid levels to 6 and under.

This time he gave me a 3-day Prednosine scrip, and when I'm finished that, I'm supposed to take Indomethacin.  But I thought that was just for pain, and not for the actual flare?

I had my first gout attack in my early 20's and was able to avoid future flare-ups for a while via changing my diet and taking 1.8 mg colchicine upon (suspected) onset of symptoms.

I've been lurking on this sub for a while. I have never been diagnosed with gout however after being on this sub for a while and looking up other symptoms I believe I have gout.

However when I went to the doctors 2 days ago they said they're treating me for Plantar Fasciittis as I'm too young for gout (25M)

Did anyone else struggle with this as a diagnosis before gout? 

Now Im not one to act as if I know more or better than a doctor but I had to question whether that was the right diagnosis. 

My symptoms:
1. Pain and when I say pain I mean a lot of it. It's brought tears to my eyes. It's my big toe that is causing the most pain. 
2. Cold and shivery and then hot the next
3. Blue foot with swelling. 
4. Stiff toe and unable to move it
5. Confusion

I had codiene and also Naproxen prescribed to me however these have done nothing in regards to ease or relieve my pain. 

I understand I can't take Reddit as medical advice however I'm just looking for someone with common ground who might be able to offer some form of relief.

**Purpose:** The aim of this study was to assess the superiority of low fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAPs) diet plus Bacillus coagulans supplementation to low FODMAP diet alone in the reduction of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms.

**Methods:** In this randomized clinical trial, fifty IBS patients who met Rome IV criteria for IBS were randomly assigned to receive a low FODMAP diet plus either a probiotic or a placebo capsule for 8 weeks. Probiotic capsules contained 109B. coagulans spores and 400 mg inulin, while placebo capsules consisted of 500 mg rice starch.

**Results:** Significant improvements were observed in abdominal pain intensity and frequency, abdominal distension, satisfaction with bowel habits, quality of life, defecation consistency, and patient-reported severity score in both groups; however, only improvement in severity score was significantly higher in probiotic group compared with placebo group (P = 0.001). Moreover, the frequency of patients with clinical improvement in IBS-symptom severity scale (IBS-SSS) was significantly more in probiotic group compared to placebo group (P = 0.038).

362,r193tx,t5_2syer,"5 week gout battle.. over.
Holy smokes what a journey. 

Happy to report, I still have both my toes :) I almost had to shed one you get it.

On a much more serious note: This was the worst gout attack of my life. Im 30, and was first diagnosed with gout when I was 16 (thanks mom). 

The first feeling of gout occurred immediately after my buddies wedding last month where we all enjoyed way too many adult beverages

As we know, it started with that bone-shaking tingling feeling. Which rapidly moved into a full blown attack with what looked like a golf ball lodged in my big toes joint. 

Sure, prednisone and indomethacin helped But it didnt do the job. This was a bad flare up, like very bad. After drinking gallons of water (to the point of water-toxicity), a good amount of cherry juice, veggies, etc. Nothing was helping. 

To the point, I started googling permanent gout. Yikes. 

Then one day, a good friend of mine asked if I had given acupuncture a shot? I had not. Outside of not being a huge fan of needles, I said what the heck and gave it a try 

I kid you not

One of the best decisions of my life. 

In 5 days, just 3 sessions later, that once described golfball in my left big toe, actually looks better than my right big toe (that doesnt have gout). 

I can walk!

See, the acupuncture was able to reduce the tension in my joints and drive my immune system to the point of the pain. After 1-2 weeks, the body registers the attack as non-fatal, so it lets up on the focus to pay attention to other bodily needs. 

Furthermore, the acupuncture can help process fluids that have become stale and hard (bone-like) over time. If youve had gout for years like I, this crap is still there and will just compound..

I come to you today, a changed man. This was a lifestyle moment, and a lifestyle change is only fitting.

Hi

I've never really had acid reflux life, however from Christmas morning until now it's been pretty constant. 

Everything I eat seems to be giving me acid reflux and I can't even drink water without burping and tasting acid at the back my throat. 

I feel totally fine in the morning and by around mid afternoon I'm having acid reflux that will persist until I go to bed - I do feel fine when laying down.

I do take Apixaban and have done for 5 months to treat a DVT and have read this can cause reflux symptoms. Have been unable to check if I can take Omeprazole with this medication as pharmacies have been closed for Christmas.

Just seeing if this is what other people experience? My diet has not changed at all and it just came on suddenly and now won't leave me alone! 

Thanks for reading

Hello. First of all thank you for taking the time to read my post, I ve found this sub very helpful full of knowledgeable people.

Here is my story, Im hoping someone can help me understand a little better what happened to me

 I started drinking alcohol at 15, smoking weed at 16, I got paranoia from it but did not quit as I was kind of self medicating for teenage depression and my friends did it too. Did other party drugs during this time but dont think these were a major issue.
Then at 19 I started using LSD. The second trip was truly traumatic, for almost 3 years I had flashbacks to another unsettling reality, some things Id see in the street, or topics of conversation, or even taste would trigger it. I would get stuck in very distorted mental state
I also had really bad anxiety (felt like I couldnt beat her 24/7 for months and years at a time) and other issues like cyclical obsessions with certain topics, I thought I was going crazy sometimes.

As a response to my mental state I quit all drugs and started to try taking care of myself properly. 

The distortions and such happen a lot less now (Im 26 atm) but I still get pretty bad paranoia and parallel reality from time to time, last time it happened on a hangover after having sex with a friend - it was triggered by looking at trees (this was a main trigger from the lsd flashbacks) but I think I also have some sexual trauma thats playing into this, because I am more prone to experience these episodes after having sex with men.

Could someone tell me if what I ve experienced is more related to ptsd, to psychosis, both, none? I think it would help me labelling it. Any other comments welcome too.

I also think I have adhd, Im trying to get help for this now.

372,ry91p7,t5_2qlaa,"Convinced I have Stomach Cancer
Hi guys,

&#x200B;

I just wanted to reach out to get some opinions on my current situation and what not.

&#x200B;

I've experienced acid reflux for quite a number of years now, on and off, kind of severe at stages, this is over probably about 5-6 years now. I would say the past few years it's even worse.

Lately over the past couple of months, probably 4-5 months, it's been worse, I have been losing weight despite eating, probably some periods in there I probably haven't eaten enough, but my appetite has remained fairly consistent. I have lost about 6 kg in around 4 months now.

I have been in a very stressful situation the past 4-5 months as well, my father had a stroke and then it was found that he had lung cancer, this put a lot of stress/burden on myself as I had to help take care of him and work as well, however I don't want to put this all down to just stress just in case it's not the cause of what's been happening.

I'm having stomach issues fairly consistently, acid reflux, heartburn, indigestion, feelings of hunger.

Symptoms seem to all point to stomach cancer, though I know looking things up doesn't help.

I've been to a doctor, doctor didn't think it was cancer because of my age, I am 33. I have an urgent referral to a specialist however to get checked up, unfortunately it's already been 3 weeks and I haven't heard anything yet.

I don't appear to be gaining weight back, over the past 4 weeks I don't really appear to be losing much more weight and if so, barely any. But I am finding after waking up, I seem to have lost a lot of weight, then kind of put it back on but I think that's mostly water weight.

I kinda feel like it's cancer speeding up my metabolism.

Sometimes I feel like not eating much but that's not not very often at all, but that's due to the stomach issues, but for the most part I am still eating, not getting any food stuck in my throat or any of that.

I don't take NSAIDs as I read that can cause stomach issues, I don't believe I have a H pylori infection, though that hasn't been confirmed yet. So I think the chances of having a stomach ulcer are probably quite slim.

I am not vomiting blood or passing any blood in my stools as well.

&#x200B;

\*\*UPDATE\*\* After 5 weeks from being referred I received a letter to do blood tests. (checked over the tests, fairly sure my GP could have done all these and sent them to the specialist, would have been ideal..)

&#x200B;

\*\*UPDATE\*\* Had a virtual meeting with a specialist, wasn't a GI specialist sadly, was referred to a specialist of general medicine apparently. Wasn't very helpful, was asked to do blood tests, if nothing comes back on blood tests, was advised I will need scans done. Asked about endoscopy, doesn't appear that they want to perform an endoscopy on me. It's taken 6 weeks just to get to the beginning of it all.

**UPDATE** Did some blood tests, confirmed no kidney issues, diabetes or thyroid issues, got a few more blood tests to do then apparently I have to do scans, I mentioned I wanted an endoscopy but was ignored and denied, they don't seem to think I have stomach cancer...

**UPDATE** Some new symptoms have cropped up, stools have been much lighter than normal for 2-3 months now, some cases of diarrhea and constipation as well as sometimes thin stools.",claim,I don't take NSAIDs as I read that can cause stomach issues,1947,2005,59,(S (NP (PRP I)) (VP (VBP do) (RB n't) (VP (VB take) (NP (NNS NSAIDs)) (SBAR (SBAR (IN as) (S (NP (PRP I)) (VP (VBP read)))) (SBAR (WHNP (WDT that)) (S (VP (MD can) (VP (VB cause) (NP (NN stomach) (NNS issues)))))))))),S,1

374,ontwk7,t5_2syer,"Development into chronic gout (advice needed)
Hey! Hope you guys are doing well.

Like many of you, I am diagnosed with having gout. I first started having my first flare up around 2015. I was only 16 at the time. I was diagnosed through a blood test that showed high uric acid levels. Since then, I have had gout flare up pretty much once every year, treating it with ibuprofen only.

As a way to reduce my uric acid levels, I reduced meat/seafood consumption, having vegetarian days and lost weight (though not super drastically) to a healthier bmi. However, it seems to not be working as it still happens every year. Same spot every time.

Around 3 years ago, I had bursitis as well on my elbow, which had happened again a couple months ago. Inflamation in bursa sacs can be attributed to gout though the inflamation did not get tested for uric acid.

Now at 21 year of age, I think my gout is developing to chronic gout. My last attack was 2 months ago, with an episode of bursitis right before that, and now, as with many people, am now awaken at 4am in the morning to pain on my big toe. This is the second time in the year with one 2 months before, which I think now classifies as chronic gout.

At the start, the doctor was hesistant on putting me on uric acid lowering medication like allupurinol because I was so young. Now, at 21, with more frequent attacks, one happening pretty much back to back after the previous one, I am starting to think medication is the only way to prevent this. But I am still what most people and doctors would agree to be very young to have chronic gout.

My question to you guys: should I request my doctor to put me on uric acid lowering medication?

Tldr: First gout at 16. Now I'm 21 and having 2nd gout attack of year for first time. Time to go on uric acid lowering medication or still too young?",claim,I think my gout is developing to chronic gout,878,922,45,(S (NP (PRP I)) (VP (VBP think) (SBAR (S (NP (PRP$ my) (NN gout)) (VP (VBZ is) (VP (VBG developing) (PP (IN to) (NP (JJ chronic) (NN gout))))))))),S,1
375,spyqsp,t5_2s3g1,"1st Colonoscopy Next Week-A Bit Nervous on My Symptoms
Hi all-

Late thirties, male.  A bit of a control freak about my health which is probably why I am down the rabbit hole and worried about this scope next week.

I have always had on/off constipation but typically without any real pain.  Naturally, some discomfort but nothing I would consider pain.  Typically, I would barely go during the week then have a couple normal BMs on the weekend.  I travel a lot and usually eat high protein/a bit short on fiber diet so I do not think much of this.  A couple months ago though, I started having smaller stools and not having my weekend BM's.  When I do have them, they can look sometimes odd shaped with indentions, sometimes square edges and typically no bigger than walnuts although sometimes I get half-way normal looking ones that are about 3 inches in length.  TMI I am sure.  For my diet, I eat spinach and blueberries literally everyday in a shake so the color of everything is usually darker shade of brown but certainly not black. 

Anyways, last couple of weeks I have really upped the fiber to the 38gm/day typically and I have been having BMs daily but, they are still in pieces.  No straining 99% of them time and they just come out clean but, in pieces.  In regards to blood, only once have I seen pink blood on the TP after the day prior I did have to strain and had what I would call a peanut BM.  Have not seen anything else.  Please keep in mind I exercise daily, eat 160-190gm protein/day and around 130gm carbs/day along with 50gm/fat.  Last 2 weeks i have used metamucil and chia seeds to see if it helps.

Went to the GI and expected them to listen to my diet and tell me to try miralax or something else but instead, they talked to me for 5 minutes and decided I should get a colonoscopy.  Based on lots of the info I have read here, that seems strange since some of you guys seem to have to demand one.  So naturally, it makes me nervous to think the docs expect something more sinister but they insisted it was more to rule things out.

So, end of next week I get my first colonoscopy.  From what I have read, IBS usually presents with pain which I have none of.  This makes me a bit anxious.  **Have any of you experienced similar symptoms minus ""pain"" and it been nothing?**  I Have no family history of the big C but, my mom/grandmother/aunt does struggle with bowel issues and mainly constipation so I am hoping I just get it honest.  One of the things that is keeping me somewhat positive is that I had CT scans about 16 months ago for something unrelated and there was nothing in my pelvic/abdomen.  Of course, things can change but at least back then they saw zero.

Sorry for the novel but, really anxious and somewhat neurotic about this.",claim,"From what I have read, IBS usually presents with pain which I have none of",2112,2185,74,"(S (PP (IN From) (SBAR (WHNP (WP what)) (S (NP (PRP I)) (VP (VBP have) (VP (VBN read)))))) (, ,) (NP (NNP IBS)) (ADVP (RB usually)) (VP (VBZ presents) (PP (IN with) (NP (NP (NN pain)) (SBAR (WHNP (WDT which)) (S (NP (PRP I)) (VP (VBP have) (NP (NP (NN none)) (PP (IN of))))))))))",S,1

Hey everyone, so I posted in here about a week ago for the first time and first of all I wanted to thank you all for the support and all the questions I had answered. So a quick recap: diagnosed with gout in the right ankle, probably caused by drinking. So to follow up, Ive been on Prednisone now since Friday and its helped a ton with the pain and my ankle has nearly returned completely to normal, however I am now getting a bit of a flare up in my left toe (the other foot). So my questions are: is this normal? And is there something Im doing wrong? 

Also, I talked to my family doctor on Monday and she believed that this could be a one time thing but now with this second flare up Im not too sure. I asked about a rheumatologist (everyones said I should talk to one) but she said theres nothing more they could tell me that I havent heard already. Another questionable thing she told me was that if the medication Im on for blood pressure, between the diuretic and diltiazem, she thinks the latter is more likely to have caused the gout. But diltiazem only has like a 1-2% chance of causing gout whereas a diuretic is a leading cause in a lot of cases Ive read. So Im also seeking advice on whether or not I should just call her back and get her to send me to a specialist or wait and see how this toe flare up goes.",claim,this could be a one time thing but now with this second flare up Im not too sure,648,727,80,(S (S (NP (DT this)) (VP (MD could) (VP (VB be) (NP (DT a) (NML (CD one) (NN time)) (NN thing))))) (CC but) (S (ADVP (RB now)) (PP (IN with) (NP (DT this) (JJ second) (NN flare) (RB up))) (VBP I) (VP (VBP m) (ADJP (RB not) (RB too) (JJ sure))))),S,1

385,sv5nh4,t5_2s3g1,"Had an all clear Colonoscopy today! What should I do next?
While awaiting my scope, I read a ton of these posts (I'm excited for a response from goldstandardalmond). 34yo male, never had any IBS issues until this past Thanksgiving. I do feel it was stress related because during that time I had job related issues, new baby on the way, family issues, etc. During that stressful time I vaped weed almost daily. I traveled for Thanksgiving to two different places. Normally takes me a while to get adjusted to a different place to have a movement. I didn't have a significant movement for 1.5 weeks during that travel. That never happens to me, always regular (2-3 times per day). I also didn't have weed or my daily smoothie, during the travel.

When I got home, I decided to use Benefiber for the first time, thinking it would help. I added the total daily amount and didn't start slowly (big mistake). That's when the following symptoms started:

* Incomplete evacuation
* Bloating/Trapped gas
* Green Stool (IBS-M type)
* Undigested food in stool

Then I went to Dr. Google, thought I had the big C and was going to die. These symptoms persisted for a month:

* High Anxiety
* Headaches
* Frequent urination
* small stool caliber
* light abdomen pain that alternated all over
* can feel bowel and rectum spasm inside
* some mucus 

I then focused on relaxing more, prolonged fasted, alternated Slippery Elm, Psyllium Husk, Chia Seeds and Magnesium Citrate to my smoothie. Had great success with Psyllium husk (really bulked up stool and helped improve evacuation) but then it stopped working after a week. All symptoms disappeared during prolonged water-only fasting (48hrs). After fasting and up to today the following systems occur:

* bowel spams/dull pain that alternates around abdomen
* hard flat short stools like one or twice a day. IF the fiber actually works then the stool is bulky and normal. Also looks like you can see bowel constriction marks on it.
* incomplete evacuation
* undigested food from time to time
* Nausea at random times with metallic/bitter taste

The good scope result is a huge relief but its now time to investigate further. Felt like my gastro didn't give a crap about the stress aspect or many of the symptoms. He thought it was some sort of bacteria infection. My thoughts are to see a functional medicine doctor and therapist.  Any other thoughts or things try, tests to request?

I (33m) have just been diagnosed with gout, so officialy on my first flare up but knowing what I know now. I'v probably had a flare up some years ago without knowing it (was not in a textbook place....).

&#x200B;

Trying to figure out if I have food triggers or just bad luck. But reading some on the internet and starting to realise it will be a painfull game of trial and error. I'v wondered for those of you who have food triggers how fast after eating does the pain start (right away, after few hours or that night,......) ? 

I think that my gout might be linked to an iron deficiency (or at least my flare up)  that showed up in my bloodwork, and found some sources online that talk about that. But just like anything regarding gout I'm not sure if i can trust them..... 

So anybody here that noticed something like that for themself or i'm I just making stuff up to feel better ?",claim,"I think that my gout might be linked to an iron deficiency (or at least my flare up)  that showed up in my bloodwork, and found some sources online that talk about that",651,818,168,"(S (NP (PRP I)) (VP (VBP think) (SBAR (IN that) (S (NP (PRP$ my) (NN gout)) (VP (MD might) (VP (VB be) (VP (VBN linked) (PP (IN to) (NP (NP (NP (NP (DT an) (NN iron) (NN deficiency)) (-LRB- -LRB-) (CC or) (NP (ADVP (RB at) (RBS least)) (PRP$ my) (NN flare) (NN up)) (-RRB- -RRB-)) (SBAR (WHNP (WDT  )) (SBAR (WDT that) (S (VP (VBD showed) (PRT (RP up)) (PP (IN in) (NP (PRP$ my) (NN bloodwork)))))))) (, ,) (CC and) (VP (VBD found) (NP (DT some) (NNS sources)) (ADVP (RB online)) (SBAR (WHNP (WDT that)) (S (VP (VBP talk) (PP (IN about) (NP (DT that))))))))))))))))",S,1

430,s6hpz7,t5_2saq9,"Dr says I have OH even though my blood pressure is totally normal
Hi guys,

I'm super frustrated and confused so I figured I'd ask for help here 

I (21f) was diagnosed with OH a few months ago after several years of fainting upon getting out of bed (1-2 times a year, other symptoms as well). Cardiologist did the lying/sitting/standing test, and my heart rate went WAY up, blood pressure stayed the same. He diagnosed me with OH.

I did some research and at the follow-up appointment asked how it would be possible for me to have OH since my blood pressure was totally fine but my heart rate went up, and wouldn't that indicate POTS instead? 

He said (and I quote) ""it's not POTs, cause for POTs we would prescribe more of an exercised-based approach""

Idk if I'm crazy or what, but that doesn't sound like a real answer to me??? The treatment changing isn't a reason to not diagnose someone with something.

434,rzva7x,t5_2s1h9,"My boyfriend's brother: intractable, hypermotor seizures. Can anyone relate?
Hi,
I have recently joined reddit for another issue unrelated to what I will post about here. My boyfriend and his mom for the past five years have been caregivinging for my boyfriend's 29 y.o. brother. 

My boyfriend's brother has an unusual form of epilepsy. He has multiple seizures a day, and has had them every day starting 5 years ago. He has, as I understand it, hypermotor seizures, and does not have the tonic clonic seizures. So when he has individual seizures, he doesn't need to go the the ER, but the seizures involve a lot of arm and leg movement, and he can injure himself, or potentially injure others, quite seriously. 

My boyfriend's brother has had epilepsy since he was a baby. His epilepsy has always been intractable, but before the increase in his seizures five years ago he would generally have nighttime seizures that didn't impact his daily life. I don't know a lot about his medication, but I know he is on quite high amounts of anti-seizure medication. I know that the college of pharmacists in our area issues him a letter every so often, because he is on a very high doses of anti-seizure medication. As I think people know here in this subreddit, the anti-seizure medication has lots of side effects that affect daily life. My boyfriend's brother is also trying professionally prescribed CBD treatments, but he finds this frustrating because the cbd is not covered by our government Healthcare plans and he pays a high amount for CBD oil and doesn't feel like it's making much of a difference. 

He also had a neuro surgery to help, but after a few months the seizures became just as frequent as they were before the surgery. I believe it was confirmed my boyfriend's brother has ""focal cortical displasia."" My understanding is that neurologists were able to confirm this after examining brain tissue after the surgery.

His form of epilepsy has affected his daily life quite a bit. My boyfriend's whole family would like him to live at home. Another problem is the uncertainty of the situation.  My boyfriend's brother and the whole family hopes the situation will improve, but there is no knowledge about what can be expected. I think the other option is to put their 29 year old family member in long term care, which the family is very uncertain about and saddened about putting a loved one, as a young man, into a long term care facility. They do not want to pursue this option. I don't know if anyone here has had this challenge: whether to put a loved one (or personally deciding) about going into a long term care facility, or trying to live at home.

Is there anyone else here who has experience, personally or another loved one, with intractable epilepsy, focal cortical displasia, or with hypermotor seizures? 

I think it is a more rare form of epilepsy, and I don't believe a lot of people in the city where we live has very many people, if there is anyone at all, who have the same condition as my boyfriend's brother. I would like to learn more. 

I don't live with my boyfriend's brother. At the moment the mom, and the two brothers are all living together to support one another. As I date my boyfriend over time, I am here with the family during weekends, over holidays and such. Although my boyfriend's brother is an adult, and I don't live with the family, i am not really involved in his care, I'm just more of a witness to what's going on with the family, and am interested to learn more.

436,s75yrr,t5_2s23e,"Booster advice? Just diagnosed and not on DMT yet
Hey everyone. Long time lurker, first time poster. I was hoping I wouldnt have to join this group but my diagnosis was confirmed last week and here I am. I will say Im already grateful for this group and the wealth of knowledge and positivity here. 

So heres my dilemma: Im currently in limbo waiting to see a neurologist and get on a DMT, and feeling unsure what I should be doing for my covid booster. The wait time to see the neuro could be 1 - 8 weeks 
 
My concerns specifically:

- I still have symptoms from the relapse that led to my diagnosis. I dont know if this is considered an active relapse or my body is healing? Some symptoms have completely resolved, some improved, and some are the same.   The newest symptom onset was Dec. 26.

- I do want to get the booster ASAP due to omicron threat, and the fact that once Im on a DMT I wont get as good of an immune response 

- Im scared that the booster could cause another relapse but then again, I know covid would be worse 

- I had Pfizer for both first and second shots, minimal side effects (relapse did not happen until 4 months after second dose). I have the option to get Pfizer or Moderna. Im leaning toward Pfizer but would like to hear others thoughts and experiences  


Lastly, I understand the best thing for me to do is speak to a health care professional. I have, and the general guidance is to get the vaccine and either one is fine. However none of the professionals Ive talked to specialize in MS and so Im just looking for additional information/guidance/peace of mind from this community.

I (26F) had suffered with severe heartburn for years, but Tums, Pepto and a glass of milk seemed to help. In January 2021, I had severe, sharp, crushing chest pain that radiated to my teeth and back and I thought I was having a heart attack. I went to the ER and they did all the cardiac blood tests,  an EKG, and a D-Dimer to look for clots. Everything checked out normal and they sent me home, only for it to happen over and over. Sometimes I would get one every day, and sometimes I wouldn't get one for weeks. I suffered with those pains all through the summer, until I finally reached out to my PCP in November. After some discussion she diagnosed me with GERD, and told me my chest pains were esophageal spasms. She had me take Zantac-360 for six weeks, which helped with the heartburn but overall didn't stop the spasms.

Last Saturday (1/1/22) I began having severe stomach pains along with a spasm. It felt like a hot fist just clenching in my stomach over and over. I had some chest heaviness with it, and my anxiety was through the roof. I dealt with it for a few  days and finally went in yesterday to get it checked out, with a new doctor. She did labs on me (all normal), and prescribed me Protonix for six weeks to see if that would ultimately stop my spasms, stomach pain and heartburn. I've done some research on Protonix and noticed some people have severe side effects - some people have mild - and some have none at all. I took my first pill last night and I'm feeling a little anxious as to what might happen. I worry about heart palpitations and seizures, as my family has a history of heart issues.

How many of you have been on Protonix? What were your experiences? Are there short-term side effects or do the most serious side effects only occur if you are on it long-term?

Also, if anyone has any input on esophageal spasms or the chest pains associated with GERD, I'd love to hear any advice/stories on that too. This has been the scariest part for me. I've spent nights wide awake praying for my heartburn to come back full force instead of having to feel another spasm. It's gotten to the point where sometimes I'm scared to go to sleep because I wonder ""what if it isn't a spasm this time?""

\*WARNING LONG POST\*

Hey everyone,

I am suffering from my first Gout flare-up. I would like to share what is happening and get some advice, hear feedback etc.

I'm 31 years old, lean muscular body, athletic, healthy mostly plant-based diet, barely drink. Not always been like this though.

I have suffered from psoriasis and IBS (accompanied with Insomnia) since I've been young, but both have been under control for a while. When I was a teenager and early 20s I was very unhealthy. Exessive alcohol, red meat, and lots of processed carbs. I started getting really sick, like really bad IBS. As well as getting ill I would also feel sick/bloated after food. My psoriasis was also horrible, with thick plaques on my head and on parts of my body and legs. I stopped eating meat about 9 years ago and through trial and error noticed that gluten was making me feel sick after eating. After cutting these out, my IBS started getting better and would only have occasional flare-ups. I still drank too much and that had an impact on my psoriasis which remained persistent. Not sleeping would give me trouble and so I would drink to sleep, an unhealthy shitty cycle.

About 6 years ago I cut sugar out my diet pretty much, weaned myself onto dark dark chocolate (which I now love), drank less and started using topical/oral CBD. My psoriasis started clearing up.

Then for the last 4 years, I really switched my life around. I started taking various longevity supplements, eating pretty much keto (pescatarian), started sporting 7 days a week. I went from being overweight/fat (85kg+) to 66kg muscular/lean. I cut alcohol down to a bare minimum. Every few weeks I may have a few cocktails or a few more with the occasional party, and many times months with no drinking.  My psoriasis disappeared and IBS was virtually non-existent (spare from when I stupidly couldn't resist a few bits from my GFs delicious-looking pizza). I would like to add that I have also cooked almost every day for the past few years, healthy delicious fresh food.

About a year ago I started getting joint pain after having a fairly serious combat sports injury in my hip, which resulted in my knees being damaged too.  I went and received stem cell treatment in September. This worked and my injury was pretty much healed but I was very aware that my joints in general were super stuff and clicked (way more than the average person).

Then in October, my house burned down in a horrible accident whilst I was away on holiday. I spent November and December living in a hotel room, before staying at a friend's place for Xmas and new year, before flying to Mexico (where I am currently). During the period in the Hotel, my diet slipped slightly, I was having to eat more processed foods (room service) but nothing crazy unhealthy.

Over the holiday period, I drank way more than I usually would. Xmas eve, day n boxing day. Nye, day and the day after. A lot for me but not a lot compared to most people I know. My diet was less healthy than usual and I had more sugar than my usual (almost zero) but still hardly any in the grand scheme of things. I then flew to Mexico a week ago and had 3 nights where I had alcoholic drinks and a fair amount of seafood.

Then 3 days ago after cycling 20km I went to go get a glass of water and suddenly felt immense pain in my foot. I immediately thought I had broken my foot. My toe/foot was swollen at the side and shiny red. I don't really like visiting hospitals or doctors after being given so much bad advice/medicine previously, so I thought I would wait and see if it was as bad the next day. That night I thought I was dying, which sounds so stupid as it was just a foot! I hobbled to the hospital yesterday and they did an x-ray and blood test. Lo and behold my uric acid level was 8.0 and my inflammatory markers were way high.

They told me I had gout and gave me some prescriptions and a bunch of painkillers. I've lived to deal with chronic pain (without painkillers) for years with my IBS and the injury I mentioned previously however this is a whole new level. Last night I caved and took a lot of painkillers, which only slightly helped.

I am currently sitting here in agony after drinking water with lemon all day (many litres) needing to hobble to the toilet constantly. To all those who have been suffering from this before, wow, fair play. It is horrible.

All the videos/advice online tells me to follow a certain diet (similar to how I eat already) and drink little alcohol (the moderate amount is WAY more than I drink!). I assume that the 2 months of being slightly less healthy have caused this, but it seems pretty crazy that it could cause something that quick and when in comparison to many people it's still been a healthy two months. Going by what I read online, my diet lately just doesn't seem unhealthy compared to what people eat on average, especially those who often suffer from Gout

I wonder if anyone else has Gout who has experienced something similar?

Anybody live a healthy lifestyle and is a similar age but suffer from inflammation-induced Gout?

I read online those with Psoriasis can have higher chances (3 to 5x) more of developing it even if healthy. If so what can you do? I would like to add that I had a TINY patch of Psoriasis appearing after being stressed from the fire, but still a minor flare-up.

I also wondered how effective tart cherry supplements are? I already have been taking MSM and other recommend joint supplements for years.

Does anyone know about the likelihood of it returning and also developing into Psoriatic arthritis (my biggest fear)?

Is it possible to have a one off attack?

Sorry for the ridiculously long message and thanks in advance to anyone who can help. <3

I went from being overweight/fat (85kg+) to 66kg muscular/lean. I cut alcohol down to a bare minimum. Every few weeks I may have a few cocktails or a few more with the occasional party, and many times months with no drinking.  My psoriasis disappeared and IBS was virtually non-existent (spare from when I stupidly couldn't resist a few bits from my GFs delicious-looking pizza). I would like to add that I have also cooked almost every day for the past few years, healthy delicious fresh food.

About a year ago I started getting joint pain after having a fairly serious combat sports injury in my hip, which resulted in my knees being damaged too.  I went and received stem cell treatment in September. This worked and my injury was pretty much healed but I was very aware that my joints in general were super stuff and clicked (way more than the average person).

Then in October, my house burned down in a horrible accident whilst I was away on holiday. I spent November and December living in a hotel room, before staying at a friend's place for Xmas and new year, before flying to Mexico (where I am currently). During the period in the Hotel, my diet slipped slightly, I was having to eat more processed foods (room service) but nothing crazy unhealthy.

Over the holiday period, I drank way more than I usually would. Xmas eve, day n boxing day. Nye, day and the day after. A lot for me but not a lot compared to most people I know. My diet was less healthy than usual and I had more sugar than my usual (almost zero) but still hardly any in the grand scheme of things. I then flew to Mexico a week ago and had 3 nights where I had alcoholic drinks and a fair amount of seafood.

Then 3 days ago after cycling 20km I went to go get a glass of water and suddenly felt immense pain in my foot. I immediately thought I had broken my foot. My toe/foot was swollen at the side and shiny red. I don't really like visiting hospitals or doctors after being given so much bad advice/medicine previously, so I thought I would wait and see if it was as bad the next day. That night I thought I was dying, which sounds so stupid as it was just a foot! I hobbled to the hospital yesterday and they did an x-ray and blood test. Lo and behold my uric acid level was 8.0 and my inflammatory markers were way high.

They told me I had gout and gave me some prescriptions and a bunch of painkillers. I've lived to deal with chronic pain (without painkillers) for years with my IBS and the injury I mentioned previously however this is a whole new level. Last night I caved and took a lot of painkillers, which only slightly helped.

I am currently sitting here in agony after drinking water with lemon all day (many litres) needing to hobble to the toilet constantly. To all those who have been suffering from this before, wow, fair play. It is horrible.

All the videos/advice online tells me to follow a certain diet (similar to how I eat already) and drink little alcohol (the moderate amount is WAY more than I drink!). I assume that the 2 months of being slightly less healthy have caused this, but it seems pretty crazy that it could cause something that quick and when in comparison to many people it's still been a healthy two months. Going by what I read online, my diet lately just doesn't seem unhealthy compared to what people eat on average, especially those who often suffer from Gout

I wonder if anyone else has Gout who has experienced something similar?

Anybody live a healthy lifestyle and is a similar age but suffer from inflammation-induced Gout?

I read online those with Psoriasis can have higher chances (3 to 5x) more of developing it even if healthy. If so what can you do? I would like to add that I had a TINY patch of Psoriasis appearing after being stressed from the fire, but still a minor flare-up.

I also wondered how effective tart cherry supplements are? I already have been taking MSM and other recommend joint supplements for years.

Does anyone know about the likelihood of it returning and also developing into Psoriatic arthritis (my biggest fear)?

Is it possible to have a one off attack?

Sorry for the ridiculously long message and thanks in advance to anyone who can help. <3

444,s6d6mg,t5_2s23e,"Avoiding high efficacy drugs?
Hey all,

I have just been at my neuro and finally got confirmed what I assumed all along: I have got MS.


Well, I did quite substantial research on MS beforehand and aimed for high efficacy treatment such as Kesimpta before talking to the doctor. I was very biased towards this treatment as I assumed to have highly active MS for the following reasons: I have multiple lesions in the CNS and spinal cord; one lesion is active while the others are inactive (meaning they occured at different times). I have only had one clinically isolated syndrome however, affecting my sensibility only.

When I talked to the doctor he told me I most likely have a mild version of MS (because it affects my sensibility only) and he would suggest starting with low to mid efficacy medication: copaxone, avonex, rebif, aubagio or tecfidera. When I protested, he told me that e.g. ocrevus or kesimpta would not be paid for by the public health system -> I am living in Europe. And that high efficacy medications would mean a higher risk of side effects. Well, I told him I am aware of this and think it is still a good idea as I want to avoid any further lesions as much as possible but he argued against it (costs too much, risks too high, etc).

I want to add that this doctor is a university professor specializing on MS and often a keynote speaker at international MS congresses. So he should know what he is talking about, also in terms of current research. Still, I don't feel fully convinced and want to ask a second doctor for her recommended plan of action.


What do you think? Is it true that for ""mild"" MS high efficacy treatment is not recommended as a first drug? What are your experiences and what country/continent are you from? These information would help me to better understand his opinion.

THANKS!!


P.s.: I think the prof really didn't like me telling him his opinion is not ""state of the art"" and I am aware this was very insensitive of me to say to a prof but I really felt displeased with his explanations as most of them where about the costs, higher risks and lack of long term studies rather than efficacy of the treatment.",claim,"When I talked to the doctor he told me I most likely have a mild version of MS (because it affects my sensibility only) and he would suggest starting with low to mid efficacy medication: copaxone, avonex, rebif, aubagio or tecfidera",621,852,232,"(S (SBAR (WHADVP (WRB When)) (S (NP (PRP I)) (VP (VBD talked) (PP (IN to) (NP (DT the) (NN doctor)))))) (NP (PRP he)) (VP (VP (VBD told) (NP (PRP me)) (SBAR (S (NP (PRP I)) (ADVP (RBS most) (RB likely)) (VP (VBP have) (NP (NP (DT a) (JJ mild) (NN version)) (PP (IN of) (NP (NNP MS)))) (-LRB- -LRB-) (SBAR (IN because) (S (NP (PRP it)) (VP (VBZ affects) (NP (PRP$ my) (NN sensibility)) (ADVP (RB only))))) (-RRB- -RRB-))))) (CC and) (S (NP (PRP he)) (VP (MD would) (VP (VB suggest) (S (VP (VBG starting) (PP (IN with) (NP (NP (ADJP (JJ low) (IN to) (JJ mid)) (NN efficacy) (NN medication)) (: :) (NP (NP (NN copaxone)) (, ,) (NP (NN avonex)) (, ,) (NP (NN rebif)) (, ,) (NP (NN aubagio)) (CC or) (NP (NNS tecfidera))))))))))))",S,1

Based on some light Googling, there seems to be a connection with those who have eczema and IBS. I suffer from both, eczema since I was young, and IBS-D (undiagnosed, currently working with GI doc) over the past couple months.

Google results show that those with eczema or IBS have higher levels of IL-13 and other interleukin proteins. A couple months before I started having IBS symptoms, I started reducing and salvaging my Dupixent intake because my health insurance changed and my new one didn't approve the use of this medication immediately (this is something I'm still working on with them and my doc). Since realizing, I've been taking L-glutamine supplements, which is supposed to help block IL-13, amongst other benefits for intestinal health that I'm sure this subreddit is already aware of.

I wanted to share my story in hopes it could possibly help someone or there are other people going through what I'm experiencing.   
Like many others here my story began several years ago with constant nagging, gnawing heartburn for which I was prescribed Omeprazole. This seemed to remedy my symptoms, and even though I've always had a fear/aversion to being on a long-term medication before I knew it, it had been 3 years or so. Until one day the original symptoms came back, and this time way worse. I began experiencing that feeling of a fist trying to punch its way up and out of my chest. I even questioned if I had heart issues. It was pretty awful, so after several rounds of tests, including an Endoscopy, I was told I had a hiatal hernia. The GI Dr. switched me from 20 mg of Omeprazole to 40 mg and Pantoprazole and that calmed down the pain. Again, even though I was still wary of an even higher dose of daily medication, being relieved of the pain outweighed these fears and before I knew it, another 3 or so years had gone by being a slave to this drug.   
Then about a year ago I began having horrible pain in my pelvic region. I won't go into all the details, but nothing about it made me think it was a GI issue, more of a urologic issue. So after rounds of antibiotics for what they thought was prostatitis, CT scans, and even cystoscopy (if you don't know that that is look it up. Basically medieval torture!) - all of it inconclusive. I was so desperate I even tried acupuncture which did nothing. I was beginning to believe I had CPPS (chronic pelvic pain syndrome), when as a last-ditch desperate move I decided to try eliminating gluten from my diet. To my astonishment, within a little over a week, all of my symptoms magically vanished!  
I'm about 8 months into my gluten-free diet and feel great, but I began questioning what could have caused this. Why at the age of 41 did my body suddenly decide to reject gluten? I did a celiac test and it was negative and have no family history of gluten intolerance. After doing some research I came across a study that found a link between [PPI use and gluten intolerance](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3947159/) and my jaw hit the floor.  
I now believe this long-term use of PPIs has caused this and am currently in the process of trying to wean off the Pantoprazole by cutting it in half and taking it only every other day. The GERD symptoms have returned however so I've scheduled another appt with the GI Dr to discuss a way forward without PPIs. I'm holding out a small bit of hope that if I'm able to completely go off the PPPs the gluten intolerance could possibly reverse, but I know that's not likely.
