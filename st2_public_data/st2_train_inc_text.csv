Hi all

I just had my 3rd tysabri infusion today. I was wondering if any other people on tysabri notice they get a slight worsening of old symptoms hours after infusion? For example, normally my hug only is around the front of my chest, but its wrapped around my back now like it had in the past. Or maybe thats just what back pain feels like  So perhaps Im just getting typical side effects. I never have any side effects when Im monitored in the hour after my actual IV drip, though. 

I read an old thread on here that someone said she thinks that her immune system is retaliating because it can no longer cross the blood brain barrier. That doesnt sound scientific lol but it makes sense to me kinda. Did anyone else have trouble with their first several tysabri infusions? And how long did it take you to adjust and/or see improvement? This is my very first DMT so I have no experience with anything else. Im hoping I can see some symptom improvement in the future."

Hello! Throughout the last 1.5 years I've been eating maybe 2 cans of sardines a day on average. I realize this sounds crazy but almost everything I read showed that sardines are like salmon but without the mercury and there were even articles saying daily consumption of sardines is safe. A few months ago I had a minor gout attack (very small amount of pain) and didn't realize what it was. Then I had a much worse one 2 months later, realized what it was, went on NSAIDS etc. The pain went away almost immediately from NSAIDs, literally in 10h maybe (at least it went to 1% of what it was) the swelling went down but stayed a bit and never really went away. A few weeks later I went to the beach, had some champagne and lobster (I had read lobster wasn't so high in purines, less than chicken) [https://elevatehealthaz.com/wp-content/Purine%20Table.pdf](https://elevatehealthaz.com/wp-content/Purine%20Table.pdf) and hoped that this wouldn't do anything. I also went on a hike the next day. The day after that I got another gout attack (worse than first, not as bad as second). 

I have totally cut out sardines and pretty much all meat from my diet, I've never really had any sugar in my diet except through fruit, I follow a very strict diet 99% of the time (except when celebrating). Pretty much just oatmeal, eggs, kale, avocados, etc). 

I have read that gout can't be cured, that it's caused by a number of factors outside of diet including kidneys unable to flush uric acid quickly enough, enzymes in body from genetics producing too much uric acid, autoimmune and inflammation issues etc. I have had my kidneys tested and they flush uric acid at a normal rate, I have had my chronic inflammation levels tested (through c reactive protein liver tests) and it is normal as well. I also have had my uric acid tested at 7.9 (months after cutting out sardines). 

It seems completely reasonable that gout could be caused temporarily by a huge amount of purines and uric acid (like if you injected yourself with uric acid and got your rate to 20 or 30 for example, physically it seems like it would ALWAYS crystalize at high enough levels. For this reason (not necessarily arguing that it's true in my case) it seems like gout could be cured in some cases by lowering uric acid levels (only in people who would never get it normally and had some action that caused a huge amount of abnormal build up like eating 2-3 cans of sardines a day). 

However, I have not read anything about gout being ""cured"" and this sub seems to mainly say that diet actually has a limited impact and rarely helps (most people seem to recommend allopurinol). I totally understand this, for many people gout is caused by the factors I mentioned above, not changed by diet, but it seems reasonable that crazy diets could cause temporary gout, cured through the normalization of that diet. Is there some flaw in my reasoning here?"

(2020) --TLDR: Yes
Reference: [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31327047/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31327047/)

**Purpose:** The aim of this study was to assess the superiority of low fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAPs) diet plus Bacillus coagulans supplementation to low FODMAP diet alone in the reduction of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms.

**Methods:** In this randomized clinical trial, fifty IBS patients who met Rome IV criteria for IBS were randomly assigned to receive a low FODMAP diet plus either a probiotic or a placebo capsule for 8 weeks. Probiotic capsules contained 109B. coagulans spores and 400 mg inulin, while placebo capsules consisted of 500 mg rice starch.

**Results:** Significant improvements were observed in abdominal pain intensity and frequency, abdominal distension, satisfaction with bowel habits, quality of life, defecation consistency, and patient-reported severity score in both groups; however, only improvement in severity score was significantly higher in probiotic group compared with placebo group (P = 0.001). Moreover, the frequency of patients with clinical improvement in IBS-symptom severity scale (IBS-SSS) was significantly more in probiotic group compared to placebo group (P = 0.038).

**Conclusion:** Our results indicate that the addition of probiotic supplement containing B. coagulans to the low FODMAP diet might be superior to low FODMAP diet in alleviating IBS symptoms."

If you think about it, everyone lives in a sort-of psychosis, because most things in society are imaginative constructs. A professor in a twead coat, with a cane and a monocle, playing with the role and the demeanor of being the most-learned person while his students as servile subjects gaze up at him, supposing him an academic lord he is psychotic.

A prime minister playing king, a therapist posturing as a mans great counselor. These altered states of mind and social roles are nothing more than imaginations, not so severe as a mentally-ill person on a sleepless, 3-day bender with mania but nevertheless.

Also, if you feel youre being watched, you may be: post-9/11, there are cameras everywhere. The federal government has been found to have been listening to phone conversations and monitoring Internet search history. Rich socialite Epstein had hundreds of cameras on their facility scarcely-visible to the naked eye, even in bathrooms.

The technologic society we now live in,  the technologic state is likened unto a psychotic jungle of concrete and steel. Something like 20% of Americans are on antidepressants.

The world is mentally ill, and millions struggle through altered mental states; strong beliefs that are imposed upon others and accepted merely by social proof.

Demons descend and ascend, and patients believe themselves ill, because higher-up Magicians who are CEOs and Presidents who are in league with these spiritual powers are to convince these lower men that they are indeed crazy. Here it says, in the DSM book. Now we return to the shadows in hoods and masks to sacrifice a man. And we will be spying on you via the state apparatus which we control.

There are indeed people who are legitimately psychotic.

However, there are many others, who being told they are psychotic, are instead simply chaffed against a world far crazier, backwards, and perverse than they."

I have seen an ENT and a neuro who only said my migraines are bad and nothing they be concerned about. However, 2 weeks ago I was freaked out and decided I definitely needed to do something about this when I had to pull over on my way to work. I had a vertigo episode that blurred and doubled my vision at the same time and I honestly thought I was going to get into a car accident. I pulled over and let it pass and went to work but I felt like complete crap. I had my co worker drive me to the nearest ER and after a 5 hour wait in the lobby (due to COVID surge) I was finally evaluated by a neuro team and they did say my symptoms point to possible MS. They immediately took me in for a CT and MRI scans but those scans came back normal. Blood work also normal. I was still admitted and they gave me a cocktail of meds. The last cocktail they gave me contained boric acid and prochlorpezaine which broke my headache cycle but not my dizziness. I eventually got discharged upon my request a day early because I was extremely anxious and was in a room with 6 other patients with different conditions and I couldnt do it anymore. They told me to follow up with a neuro but that neuro cant see me for another 2 months in March. Luckily, I had already made a neuro appt 3 months ago before this last episode and my appt is finally tomorrow through FaceTime. I dont want me symptoms to be dismissed. Its been 2 years and Im getting worse. Now I have this burning sensation on my left knee that I wasnt experiencing before as well as swelling of my feet and a tightness feeling. I hate googling things but I dont know much about MS and I want to become more educated.

A Belgian study found no difference between brain volume loss (BVL) of healthy individuals and patients with MS (pwMS) that had no evident disease activity (no lesions), also known as NEDA-3.

Citing the article:

**NEDA-3 has recently been launched as an ambitious treatment goal in the clinical management of MS, striving for complete suppression of inflammatory disease activity. In patients who have obtained such a label, a significantly lower rate of BVL was demonstrated across the evaluation period, compared with their counterparts who did not [17,18], although the difference with normal aging has not been extensively investigated yet. Our study now shows a similar degree of whole brain and total gray matter volume decline in patients with MS, as measured between two MRI time points demarcating a period of NEDA-3, and a group of healthy volunteers who were matched for age and sex, suggesting that neurodegeneration can slow down to physiological levels once inflammatory disease activity has been silenced.**

What is NEDA-3?

The term no evidence of disease activity-3 (NEDA-3) has been introduced to identify patients receiving such DMT who are completely free from new relapses, MRI lesion accrual and clinical disability worsening. NEDA-3 is a composite measure with a possible twin significance: i.e., no detectable evidence of inflammation (as manifested by the absence of new relapses and MRI lesions) nor neurodegeneration (as deduced from the clinical stability).

These findings are in line with those from a prospective Norwegian cohort studyto our knowledge, the only other direct comparative trial in this fieldin which 57 patients with early relapsing-remitting MS were stratified into a NEDA-3 (49%) versus EDA (51%) category based on 1 year of follow-up. The authors did not find a statistically significant increase in annualized subcortical gray matter volume loss, using the freely available FreeSurfer (Charleston, MA, USA) analytical software, in the MS patients with NEDA-3, as compared with an age- and gender-matched control group.

*Our conclusions are seemingly contradicted by reports revealing considerable rates of MS patients achieving NEDA-3 to have a whole BVL above the anticipated pathological threshold of 0.4% per year [22,23,24]. However, such general cut-offs are unlikely to be applicable to all participants and a substantial portion was under a lower-efficacy platform DMT regimen (i.e., interferon  or glatiramere acetate), also illustrating the heterogeneity of studies addressing this issue.*

I wanted to find out if any diagnostic tests helped find a cause for your GERD. 

I am going to the GI doctor again to figure out the root cause of acid reflux since it just doesn't make sense to me that young people with normal weights etc. can be suffering like this. I read a lot of healthy 20 years old in this reddit community that have struggled with GERD for years and years. I had a endoscope last year that showed redness in my esophagus and all the GI doctor did was hand me a prescription for PPIs, hello, we know that PPIs should not be used longer than like 6 weeks and can make the issue worse. 

Anyway, I want to know what tests to ask for at the GI doctor that may find the root cause of GERD I am going soon and I want to advocate for myself.

What should I do next?
While awaiting my scope, I read a ton of these posts (I'm excited for a response from goldstandardalmond). 34yo male, never had any IBS issues until this past Thanksgiving. I do feel it was stress related because during that time I had job related issues, new baby on the way, family issues, etc. During that stressful time I vaped weed almost daily. I traveled for Thanksgiving to two different places. Normally takes me a while to get adjusted to a different place to have a movement. I didn't have a significant movement for 1.5 weeks during that travel. That never happens to me, always regular (2-3 times per day). I also didn't have weed or my daily smoothie, during the travel.

When I got home, I decided to use Benefiber for the first time, thinking it would help. I added the total daily amount and didn't start slowly (big mistake). That's when the following symptoms started:

* Incomplete evacuation
* Bloating/Trapped gas
* Green Stool (IBS-M type)
* Undigested food in stool

Then I went to Dr. Google, thought I had the big C and was going to die. These symptoms persisted for a month:

* High Anxiety
* Headaches
* Frequent urination
* small stool caliber
* light abdomen pain that alternated all over
* can feel bowel and rectum spasm inside
* some mucus 

I then focused on relaxing more, prolonged fasted, alternated Slippery Elm, Psyllium Husk, Chia Seeds and Magnesium Citrate to my smoothie. Had great success with Psyllium husk (really bulked up stool and helped improve evacuation) but then it stopped working after a week. All symptoms disappeared during prolonged water-only fasting (48hrs). After fasting and up to today the following systems occur:

* bowel spams/dull pain that alternates around abdomen
* hard flat short stools like one or twice a day. IF the fiber actually works then the stool is bulky and normal. Also looks like you can see bowel constriction marks on it.
* incomplete evacuation
* undigested food from time to time
* Nausea at random times with metallic/bitter taste

The good scope result is a huge relief but its now time to investigate further. Felt like my gastro didn't give a crap about the stress aspect or many of the symptoms. He thought it was some sort of bacteria infection. My thoughts are to see a functional medicine doctor and therapist.  Any other thoughts or things try, tests to request? Thanks"

Hello! Throughout the last 1.5 years I've been eating maybe 2 cans of sardines a day on average. I realize this sounds crazy but almost everything I read showed that sardines are like salmon but without the mercury and there were even articles saying daily consumption of sardines is safe. A few months ago I had a minor gout attack (very small amount of pain) and didn't realize what it was. Then I had a much worse one 2 months later, realized what it was, went on NSAIDS etc. The pain went away almost immediately from NSAIDs, literally in 10h maybe (at least it went to 1% of what it was) the swelling went down but stayed a bit and never really went away. A few weeks later I went to the beach, had some champagne and lobster (I had read lobster wasn't so high in purines, less than chicken) [https://elevatehealthaz.com/wp-content/Purine%20Table.pdf](https://elevatehealthaz.com/wp-content/Purine%20Table.pdf) and hoped that this wouldn't do anything. I also went on a hike the next day. The day after that I got another gout attack (worse than first, not as bad as second). 

I have totally cut out sardines and pretty much all meat from my diet, I've never really had any sugar in my diet except through fruit, I follow a very strict diet 99% of the time (except when celebrating). Pretty much just oatmeal, eggs, kale, avocados, etc). 

I have read that gout can't be cured, that it's caused by a number of factors outside of diet including kidneys unable to flush uric acid quickly enough, enzymes in body from genetics producing too much uric acid, autoimmune and inflammation issues etc. I have had my kidneys tested and they flush uric acid at a normal rate, I have had my chronic inflammation levels tested (through c reactive protein liver tests) and it is normal as well. I also have had my uric acid tested at 7.9 (months after cutting out sardines). 

It seems completely reasonable that gout could be caused temporarily by a huge amount of purines and uric acid (like if you injected yourself with uric acid and got your rate to 20 or 30 for example, physically it seems like it would ALWAYS crystalize at high enough levels. For this reason (not necessarily arguing that it's true in my case) it seems like gout could be cured in some cases by lowering uric acid levels (only in people who would never get it normally and had some action that caused a huge amount of abnormal build up like eating 2-3 cans of sardines a day). 

However, I have not read anything about gout being ""cured"" and this sub seems to mainly say that diet actually has a limited impact and rarely helps (most people seem to recommend allopurinol). I totally understand this, for many people gout is caused by the factors I mentioned above, not changed by diet, but it seems reasonable that crazy diets could cause temporary gout, cured through the normalization of that diet. Is there some flaw in my reasoning here?"

Hi,

I am having bad reaction on Plegridy (red big patches that itch long after injection was administered). It has been few months and it hasn't gotten better. I didn't have this on Betaseron, and since both are interferon I compared the additives in these injection to find the culprit.

What **Plegridy** injections have extra apart from **Betaferon (Betaseron)**  is

*L-*[*arginine*](https://www.rxlist.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=7006) *HCl* 

[*sodium acetate*](https://www.rxlist.com/sodium-acetate-drug.htm) *trihydrate*

*glacial* [*acetic acid*](https://www.rxlist.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=32085) \- this I found is strong skin and mucus membrane irritant

*polysorbate 20* \- possible allergen

**And Kesimpta has**

 *e L-arginine*

 *sodium acetate trihydrate*

*polysorbate 80* \- possible alergen

*disodium edetate dihydrate*

 *hydrochloric acid* 

So, I am hoping that the problematic ingredients giving me itchy red patches that don't fade is the glacial acetic acid which is NOT in Kesimpta. But it could also be the polysorbate, which is in both. By my own deduction, the irritating ingredient is the one which purpose it is to make the drug release gradually. Because it gets worse after 7-10th day after injection.

I am afradit I will fight for this drug and end up with the same reactions. My doctor told me I am THE ONLY ONE of his patients having local site reactions to Plegridy. Which is strange, because he said he has many patients on Plegridy and I found that according to leaflet 66% of patients have it. And only around 11% have local site reactions to Kesimpta, which is hopeful to me

I will appreciate any thoughts - reassurance from those who don't local site reaction, or replies from those who do have, or any experience going from interferon to Kesimpta.

My doctor is not of much help with this, they just suggested K-vitamin cream, which does nothing, because my skin is irritated and not bruised. They see a bruise and think it is a bruise. What helps a little bit are antihistamine cream and pills, but I don't want to take the pill every day and it doesn't help that much.

Can anyone relate?
Hi,
I have recently joined reddit for another issue unrelated to what I will post about here. My boyfriend and his mom for the past five years have been caregivinging for my boyfriend's 29 y.o. brother. 

My boyfriend's brother has an unusual form of epilepsy. He has multiple seizures a day, and has had them every day starting 5 years ago. He has, as I understand it, hypermotor seizures, and does not have the tonic clonic seizures. So when he has individual seizures, he doesn't need to go the the ER, but the seizures involve a lot of arm and leg movement, and he can injure himself, or potentially injure others, quite seriously. 

My boyfriend's brother has had epilepsy since he was a baby. His epilepsy has always been intractable, but before the increase in his seizures five years ago he would generally have nighttime seizures that didn't impact his daily life. I don't know a lot about his medication, but I know he is on quite high amounts of anti-seizure medication. I know that the college of pharmacists in our area issues him a letter every so often, because he is on a very high doses of anti-seizure medication. As I think people know here in this subreddit, the anti-seizure medication has lots of side effects that affect daily life. My boyfriend's brother is also trying professionally prescribed CBD treatments, but he finds this frustrating because the cbd is not covered by our government Healthcare plans and he pays a high amount for CBD oil and doesn't feel like it's making much of a difference. 

He also had a neuro surgery to help, but after a few months the seizures became just as frequent as they were before the surgery. I believe it was confirmed my boyfriend's brother has ""focal cortical displasia."" My understanding is that neurologists were able to confirm this after examining brain tissue after the surgery.

His form of epilepsy has affected his daily life quite a bit. My boyfriend's whole family would like him to live at home. Another problem is the uncertainty of the situation.  My boyfriend's brother and the whole family hopes the situation will improve, but there is no knowledge about what can be expected. I think the other option is to put their 29 year old family member in long term care, which the family is very uncertain about and saddened about putting a loved one, as a young man, into a long term care facility. They do not want to pursue this option. I don't know if anyone here has had this challenge: whether to put a loved one (or personally deciding) about going into a long term care facility, or trying to live at home.

Is there anyone else here who has experience, personally or another loved one, with intractable epilepsy, focal cortical displasia, or with hypermotor seizures? 

I think it is a more rare form of epilepsy, and I don't believe a lot of people in the city where we live has very many people, if there is anyone at all, who have the same condition as my boyfriend's brother. I would like to learn more. 

I don't live with my boyfriend's brother. At the moment the mom, and the two brothers are all living together to support one another. As I date my boyfriend over time, I am here with the family during weekends, over holidays and such. Although my boyfriend's brother is an adult, and I don't live with the family, i am not really involved in his care, I'm just more of a witness to what's going on with the family, and am interested to learn more. 

Does anyone have experience with this?"

Hey! Hope you guys are doing well.

Like many of you, I am diagnosed with having gout. I first started having my first flare up around 2015. I was only 16 at the time. I was diagnosed through a blood test that showed high uric acid levels. Since then, I have had gout flare up pretty much once every year, treating it with ibuprofen only.

As a way to reduce my uric acid levels, I reduced meat/seafood consumption, having vegetarian days and lost weight (though not super drastically) to a healthier bmi. However, it seems to not be working as it still happens every year. Same spot every time.

Around 3 years ago, I had bursitis as well on my elbow, which had happened again a couple months ago. Inflamation in bursa sacs can be attributed to gout though the inflamation did not get tested for uric acid.

Now at 21 year of age, I think my gout is developing to chronic gout. My last attack was 2 months ago, with an episode of bursitis right before that, and now, as with many people, am now awaken at 4am in the morning to pain on my big toe. This is the second time in the year with one 2 months before, which I think now classifies as chronic gout.

At the start, the doctor was hesistant on putting me on uric acid lowering medication like allupurinol because I was so young. Now, at 21, with more frequent attacks, one happening pretty much back to back after the previous one, I am starting to think medication is the only way to prevent this. But I am still what most people and doctors would agree to be very young to have chronic gout.

My question to you guys: should I request my doctor to put me on uric acid lowering medication?

Tldr: First gout at 16. Now I'm 21 and having 2nd gout attack of year for first time. Time to go on uric acid lowering medication or still too young?"

Sorry but I've recently been walking everyday for my arthritis and fibro, and noticed when I sit down and chill after, I get a tight and weak chest and my back and chest and ribs ache (basically my whole body aches) and I get tired and slightly dizzy. I have tachycardia and take two beta blockers in the morning and again at night. I always forget to take my beta blockers in the morning before I exercise and end up taking them after I've already done my walk.

Google (I knowwww I'm sorry) says it sounds like exercise induced bronchospasm or asthma, or it could be pots.

I'm used to all this but this chest tightness after exercise is annoying me. I've already thought I have pots and like, dysautonomia, but my doctors just think it's anxiety, tachycardia, fibro, and psoriasitic arthritis, along with hypermobility.

Hey guys, I'm hoping for some advice or stories here. 

My boyfriend was diagnosed at ~15 years old and is now 23. I am 22 and bought a house across the country. We are looking to move there, but I cannot solely provide for him should he be unable to find employment. 

COVID has been hard enough on job opportunities, but he has over a year gap in his resume and has been working part time retail jobs more recently. However, he feels like he might have a seizure now and then and this means he leaves work early. I fear they are cutting his hours because they don't see him as reliable. 

He's only had about one grand mal seizure every ~3 months, and that's because he listens to his body and rests when he needs to. 

Because of this, it looks like he doesn't qualify for federal disability benefits. They're not frequent enough, but his employers will continue to fire/cut hours until he's basically shadow-fired. 

What programs are there to help find employment? He's interested in IT, working from home at any capacity, or anything without too much physical labor. 

Are there any programs to give him a disability status that can be used to leverage more sick days at work?

If so, does it completely bar him from holding a driver's license? His seizures are well managed, but the dosages/meds he has needs tweaking since weight gain. He has gone almost a year before without seizures when he was thinner, so I'm hoping we can try and keep his rights to a license. 

Thanks everyone."

Hello!  Im a guy with MS who has previously had low testosterone numbers pre-dx (eg below 12 nmol/L).  Ive been feeling especially crappy lately (low energy stuff).  So rather than just accept its MS, I dove into the rabbit hole of trying to find why I feel crappy and came across something interesting that may affect others in here.

Since my dx, Ive been taking supplements to help control my MS.  And my regime and DMT have worked.  My MS went from highly active at dx to NEDA now.  One thing I do every day is I take a flax seed oil + curcumin capsule.

Flax seed oil reduces relapses by 60% according to this study by Dr Jelinik (of OMS diet):

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3821380/

Awesome.  I am only taking 1x1000mg capsule daily- not a lot.  However, apparently when taking with curcumin + piperine, absorption is increased.  

Now, back to me feeling crappy.  I went to an endocrinologist, described symptoms I was having, and she sent me for a blood panel.  It came back with a ridiculously high testosterone number.  Like almost 30 nmol/L - an unnatural number for my age and totally inconsistent with my prior panel.  I should be rocking a massive erection constantly.  But instead, its barely even just okay.  Likewise with body hair, I dont have very much.  And Im hardly very muscular either.  Somethings not right with that number.

So I started reading and found an association between flax seed oil and testosterone that fit:

The reason that flaxseeds are on the hit list for raising testosterone is because they are rich in lignans, which tend to mimic estrogen in the body. Since estrogen is the opposing sex hormone to testosterone, the more of it you have (particularly if you are a man), the more low testosterone-like symptoms youll have. (from: https://www.shawacademy.com/blog/6-foods-to-avoid-to-optimise-natural-testosterone/ )

Also its discussed at length in setting of PCOS at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2752973/

Whats interesting is, testosterone is associated with a neuroprotective effect in MS.  (from: https://www.mdedge.com/multiplesclerosishub/article/134428/multiple-sclerosis/testosterone-affects-outcomes-men-ms ).

The effect of estrogen-mimicking lignans fits as a culprit for feeling crappy in a hypogonadism sense - but it also seems to fit the unexplained data from Dr Jeliniks study showing how much more effective flax seed oil was compared to other Omega-3s, since lignans are a unique element not found in fish oils.

If only that Omega-3 study had an endocrine panel, this theory might be solved.  It seems like tapering down flax seed oil intake would help me feel better- but could also reduce beneficial effect of the high testosterone on my MS.

Not sure which path to take.  But an interesting set of associations!  If any smart person has any guidance or this is all wrong, would be helpful!"

Hi everyone so Ive been convinced for a long time that I have isolated CF w pancreatic symptoms because I had extreme chronic diarrhea and malabsorption that was sort of remedied by Creon. Like bathroom within 10 min of eating I know youve been there. Also most poops even with Creon would finish off with mucus coming out visibly at the end.

I started eating sourdough because I thought it would be better than normal bread. But I made the mistake of cooking the sourdough starter into pancakes without making it into a dough first and was doing this every day for about a month. Also stopped taking my Creon because they were back ordered and I didnt have an Rx card for the lower dosage.

That was a huge mistake. Over time, I am now extremely constipated but not like a normal person where its a mass causing a blockage. Instead its like the mucus has gotten so thick and somehow mixed with the food (?) or something because my poop is extremely sticky. Like the constipation is causing the poop to stick to itself to where I have a very narrow intestine and its getting a bit scary

Hey everyone, so I posted in here about a week ago for the first time and first of all I wanted to thank you all for the support and all the questions I had answered. So a quick recap: diagnosed with gout in the right ankle, probably caused by drinking. So to follow up, Ive been on Prednisone now since Friday and its helped a ton with the pain and my ankle has nearly returned completely to normal, however I am now getting a bit of a flare up in my left toe (the other foot). So my questions are: is this normal? And is there something Im doing wrong? 

Also, I talked to my family doctor on Monday and she believed that this could be a one time thing but now with this second flare up Im not too sure. I asked about a rheumatologist (everyones said I should talk to one) but she said theres nothing more they could tell me that I havent heard already. Another questionable thing she told me was that if the medication Im on for blood pressure, between the diuretic and diltiazem, she thinks the latter is more likely to have caused the gout. But diltiazem only has like a 1-2% chance of causing gout whereas a diuretic is a leading cause in a lot of cases Ive read. So Im also seeking advice on whether or not I should just call her back and get her to send me to a specialist or wait and see how this toe flare up goes."

 A research team led by Dr. Marcus Koch and Dr. Wee Yong (Co-Founder and Chief Scientific Officer of AnthoBio) at the University of Calgary that investigates a generic drug, hydroxychloroquine, in primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) recently published its clinical study results in Annals of Neurology. The study followed 35 PPMS patients over a period of five years. Throughout the study, 14 patients were expected to develop a significant reduction in their walking function. However, only 8 patients had experienced a reduction by the end of the study. Thats almost a 50% reduction in the number of PPMS patients negatively affected by continuing disability. Although the results will require confirmation in a larger trial, this study has shown that hydroxychloroquine could help slow down the disability progression of PPMS. This study opens the possibility for future treatment option for PPMS and the researchers hope their work will inspire future larger scale clinical research on the drug for PPMS.

I found myself venting to my journal and thought I'd share. If you're feeling this way, you're not alone.

&#x200B;

I know that Im not supposed to let MS take my joy like its taken so much else, but here I am. The frustrating thing is that the change is so slight to outsiders, even to me. But the changes are still there. Its this constant cloud hanging over me, like how every time I wake up and feel a scratch in the back of my throat I remember that even though I got a positive COVID test back three weeks ago, my body still hasnt completely recovered because Im immunocompromised. If I feel extra fatigued after a long day, I start rifling through my activities, wondering what could have possibly made my legs so sore, and then I remember that sometimes just going through a day makes me stiff and sore like Id done a rigorous exercise. That swallowing thing is a real bitch, too. People dont realize how alarming it is to expect your throat to just do what it always does and send the food back and down your gullet only for there to be no motion, and for the act of swallowing to become mechanical, like writing out specific instructions to your throat on how to do its job. But really, its not about the swallowing, or the night sweats, or being constantly sick, or the tingling and the numbness, or the fatigue. Its about the degeneration. Its about the fact that every time I show a symptom, Im reminded that my body has attacked that delicate myelin sheath around my nerves and that that process will continue, even if its slowed down by Ocrevus. How am I supposed to ever be okay with that?

Mom said that someday the treatments wont be so hard on me emotionally. She says it to make me feel better because she doesnt like to see anyone in pain. It doesnt help.

And the most difficult part of this whole thing is that nothing helps. Truly. Im beyond grateful for my doctors and the treatments and everything, but Im so sick of what all these people do to try to make me feel better about it. The constant flow of, its such a different disease, and but youll still have a future, and at least they caught it early sometimes makes me just want to scream. All of thats true, and I know its true. But pretty please, dont fucking tell me that again because its what I repeat to myself over and over and over again every time I feel myself starting to feel angry or upset about the disease. I promise, Ive heard it before. I promise, none of it takes away the disease. It increases the shame and guilt over my refusal to take it lightly."

I've had it come and go maybe 3 to 4 times since first time (not enough water meat dairy very little vege fruit diet did it..). Have tried change diet but it's slow and been using tart cherry (juice seems to work better than capsules), ibrufen, plenty fruit and vege (leaving out spinach... Never liked it anyway ).

How long do people find it takes for the gout lump to reduce in size?. Is there a faster way for uric crystals to reduce ? (I realize might never go completely).

Does this story sound familiar?  

I woke up one day thinking I twisted my ankle while sleeping.  It was the ankle I broke when I was a kid so I figured I re-injured it somehow while tossing and turning.  Walked gingerly and wore a brace for a week until it felt better.  A year later - the same thing.  Woke up and felt like I twisted my ankle while sleeping.  Same thing - walked gingerly and wore a brace.  Then it started happening more often.  

Finally my wife says - she thinks it might be gout.  I go see my General Practitioner - after a blood test - lo and behold UA levels of 8 mg/dL.  Gives me a prescription of 100mg of Allopurinol, Colchicine and 50mg of  Indomethacin.  Take the Colchicine and Indomethacin - pain goes away.  Think nothing of it.  Skip on the Allo because I don't want to be on life long medication.

4 years since my first gout attack - Now every year around Thanksgiving to New Years I get a gout attack because of all the rich food I ingest.  I keep around Indomethacin as colchicine no longer seems to work for me.  The rest of the time I don't really have a problem.

6 years since my first gout attack - I start getting gout attacks in random places.  Elbow, knee, wrist, top of foot, bottom of foot, Achilles.  Gout attacks start happening 2 -3 times a year.  Now I need prednisone to start dealing with the pain.  I have prednisone and indomethacin laying around the house just in case.  I try to ""eat right"" - I lose a little weight.  I no longer drink.  I find that gluten is a major trigger for me and go gluten free.  

9 years since my first gout attack - I've missed going to events because I can barely walk.  I have a cane in every room to help me hobble around.  Not only is my diet changed but I've tried every supplement out there.  Tart cherry juice, tart cherry extract, apple cider vinegar, random gout pills from amazon.  I finally have enough and ask to see a specialist.  

10 years from my first gout attack and my first Rheumatologist  visit.  My Blood serum UA levels are at 10mg/dL.  I get sent for X-rays to see if there is any joint damage.  Start at 300 mg of allopurinol. and 25mg daily indomethacin.  Go back in a month to get blood tests.  1 month later my serum levels are at 8mg/dL.  Get another 300mg of allopurinol for a total of 600mg.  1 month later my serum levels are at 5.5mg/dL.  Add 100mg for a total of 700mg of allopurinol.  1 month later my serum levels are at 5mg/dL.  Negotiate with the doc to go back to 600mg - so that I only have to have 1 prescription filled - otherwise I needed the 300mg dose and the 100mg dose both filled.

6 months after holding at 5.5mg/dL and daily low level indomethacin - I have 4 pieces of pepperoni pizza.  Next day a bad gout attack.  Take high level dose 50mg of indomethacin 3x daily until the flare goes away.  Maybe 3 days of pain.  This is my last gout attack!

5 years after being on allopurinol - taken daily religiously with my vitamins - no pain, no mobility issues.  COVID vaccine taken - no gout flares.  Why? no my crystals. 

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There seem to be several replies of late that tend to imply that some of us on this forum think UA lowering medication is the only answer.  Although it may not be the only answer - it is one that is medically proven to actually affect the real trigger of gout - monosodium urate crystals.  If you are on here often you will see me post a link to this article - ""Why does a gout attack stop""

[https://rmdopen.bmj.com/content/1/Suppl\_1/e000046](https://rmdopen.bmj.com/content/1/Suppl_1/e000046)

And I post this often because I was under the illusion that somehow MSU crystals came and went with an attack.  IE I get an attack because I formed crystals.  Then the attack went away so the crystals went away.  Understanding that stopping the flare does not mean the crystals went away is the key point I try to make to everyone.  Anecdotally - if you look at my story - really what was happening to me is my UA levels kept going up and crystals started forming all over my joints. (Hence the attacks at various parts of my body). The crystals were still there - even with my serum UA levels below 6mg/dL for 6 months.  That is why I flared when I ate my trigger food.  Crystals still didn't finish dissolving even after 6 months of ""normal UA levels"".  

What does that mean for diet?  I would change the word to lifestyle change.  You basically have to keep eating for the rest of your life - food that would keep your UA levels below 6 mg/dL so that crystals can dissolve and so that you won't form new crystals.  Also you might still flare while those crystals dissolve.  Any other diet is just dealing with the inflammation not with the MSU crystals.  You'd need to monitor your UA levels so that you know you are keeping it low.  And obviously it isn't super easy to dissolve crystals - 6 months for me - and I've read about some people in the year(s) range and still having flares.  

So please understand where I am coming from.  I am one of you.  I suffered with this for a long time thinking I could manage it.  I didn't want to take life long medication.  Maybe you can manage it - and please come back here and tell us what you are doing if you find it helpful.  I am not against alternative treatment.  What I am trying to do is spread a better understanding of the disease and hopefully some of you won't have to suffer for 10 years before seeking help."

Hi all, I am 31 years old male and recently did a general series of blood tests since I was about to leave to a remote place with poor access to medical facilities. My serum uric acid level in the test is 6.9 mg/dl. I don't have any pain like gout and I deduce this from reading posts in this community. However, I have had a slight bunion in my left foot since a couple of years. However, the pain from bunion went away once I started wearing a toe separator prescribed by an Orthopedic Physician. No pain since then. The pain comes if I don't wear the toe separator for at least a couple of days and walk around for quite some time. However, the pain only comes while walking and there is no swelling as such. I am able to bend my toe backwards. The bunion occured at a time when I was taking calcium supplements for another issue.

With the recent blood work when I went to my general physician, he asked me to take Febuxostat 40mg twice a day for 1 month, followed by once a day thereafter. This he said stating that my serum uric acid level is on the higher side. However, since the bloodwork says that the maximum value of serum uric acid is 7.0, I am confused if I should start the medication or take a second opinion. With your experience, what do you people suggest? I know that most of you might not be doctors, but I am sure that dealing with gout for long, you might have something to say.

I felt the symptoms I was experiencing were way too extreme and my so called IBS was disrupting my life at more of a level than some people I knew with IBS. I was finally diagnosed with Sibo 4 months ago. If you suspect there may be something else wrong with you please look into this!! Most doctors dont know a ton on this topic(including GI DRs) and its a strange breath test to detect. For anyone who believes they just have IBS, please disregard this message. Not trying to cause worry, just want to help if I can. If I can help change one persons life - thats enough. Let me know if you have any questions.

Edit: If you test for Sibo you have to test for all 3 types - Methane Sibo, Hydrogen Sibo, and Hydrogen Sulfide Sibo. The doctors normally only tests for Methane Sibo and Hydrogen Sibo and there is a chance your results will come up negative although you have it. This could be an inconclusive test. The reason for this is that Hydrogen Sulfide Sibo is more dominant and it competes with Methane Sibo to eat Hydrogen Sibo. When the Hydrogen Sibo is gone(all eaten) the Methane Sibo dies off leaving your results for both at 0, but you could still very well have Hydrogen Sulfide Sibo and you wouldnt know it and your DR wouldnt know it. There is a test called Trio smart breath at home test kit that tests for all 3. Order it online and get your doctor to sign off on it if you can. This is really only a concern for anyone who tests at a 0 for Methane and Hydrogen. I tested positive for both but I still need to test for Sulfide Sibo as the protocol for treating this kind is totally different than treating Methane and Hydrogen and is its own kind of beast. If you find you have Sibo get yourself a good intestinal Naturopathic Dr. to help guide you through.

Also, Sibo can cause Sifo (Fungal overgrowth) which can be tested for through a specific Endoscopy that tests for a fungus overgrowth. If you have this as well, you need to treat both. If you do not get rid of the fungus - you cant get rid of the Sibo. Fungus and bacteria compete for a hospitable living environment in your intestinal tract and this causes the bacteria to grow stronger and multiply."

Hi all. Semi frequent lurker. First time poster.

Im on about day 6 of a flare up in my big toe. This is year three of me having a flare up around the same time of year (sometime in the winter). Ive never been prescribed anything besides NSAIDs but have been taking a tapering dose of prednisone that my mother in law had in reserve (former nurse). 

This flare up is particularly frustrating because in the last year, Ive made major positive changes in my lifestyle. I went on noom, lost about 65 pounds (63, current weight 237). I have been drinking minimum 80 ounces of water a day for the last year) and intensely exercise usually 5 of 7 days a week. I also have been taking a single tart cherry extract supplement every day for over a year. I drink infrequently, maybe one night on the weekend, and not that much to boot.

Ive never felt physically better until this shit hits me like a brick.

Part of the reason I decided to make these changes was because of my first gout attack 3 years ago. Absolutely miserable experience. My dad has a history of it but I thought Id at least get a few years more before it effected me (currently 31 years old). Hes been on Allo but has never decided to lose his own weight. 

I have another doctors appointment on Friday where theyre planning to test UA levels and do a kidney analysis. 

My question is, because this seems to be a yearly thing and not as frequent an occurrence as some others in this sub have unfortunately experienced, should I bite the bullet and just demand allo? Or should I just keep a stash of prednisone on me for flare ups (even though it hasnt done much for me for this attack)?

This last attack has seemed to last longer than the others but hasnt been as acutely painful. But its gotten me a little depressed as I havent been able to move and my weight loss journey has come to a grinding halt. Any information or shared experiences would be greatly appreciated."

Psychosis/ptsd? Drug induced
Hello. First of all thank you for taking the time to read my post, I ve found this sub very helpful full of knowledgeable people.

Here is my story, Im hoping someone can help me understand a little better what happened to me

 I started drinking alcohol at 15, smoking weed at 16, I got paranoia from it but did not quit as I was kind of self medicating for teenage depression and my friends did it too. Did other party drugs during this time but dont think these were a major issue.
Then at 19 I started using LSD. The second trip was truly traumatic, for almost 3 years I had flashbacks to another unsettling reality, some things Id see in the street, or topics of conversation, or even taste would trigger it. I would get stuck in very distorted mental state
I also had really bad anxiety (felt like I couldnt beat her 24/7 for months and years at a time) and other issues like cyclical obsessions with certain topics, I thought I was going crazy sometimes.

As a response to my mental state I quit all drugs and started to try taking care of myself properly. 

The distortions and such happen a lot less now (Im 26 atm) but I still get pretty bad paranoia and parallel reality from time to time, last time it happened on a hangover after having sex with a friend - it was triggered by looking at trees (this was a main trigger from the lsd flashbacks) but I think I also have some sexual trauma thats playing into this, because I am more prone to experience these episodes after having sex with men.

Could someone tell me if what I ve experienced is more related to ptsd, to psychosis, both, none? I think it would help me labelling it. Any other comments welcome too.

I also think I have adhd, Im trying to get help for this now.

Thank you"

I think I have only officially posted like 3 times for being the OP but do make a lot of comments but wanted to get my wording right and not give false information.

~I will be editing this post as suggestions come~

Would you say that this would be the correct way to meet the criteria for POTS:

ONLY YOU know whats NORMAL for you and YOUR body so if you have ANY abnormal symptoms you should always speak to your doctor about your concerns.

For possible P.O.T.S you can do a Poor mans TTT at home and then discuss with your doctor. I would recommend saving your results on paper or on video so they can see proof and have a better understanding of whats happening but a lot of other conditions can cause POTS symptoms so they may need to run a lot of test and be patient because POTS is a process of elimination.

When doing the Poor Mans Tilt Test its best to do it for the full 10 mins and to check blood pressure as well if possible.Here is a chart that I used if you are interested:

https://batemanhornecenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/NASA-Lean-Test-Instructions-1.pdf

https://imgur.com/a/H36mjvF

If you meet the PoTs criteria:

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a blood circulation disorder characterized by two factors:

A specific group of symptoms that frequently occur when standing upright(but also with other postural changes): 
Lightheadedness,dizziness,chest pressure,Brain fog,Palpitations,Blood pooling,Feeling faint or actually fainting;just to name a few.
(You do not need to have all of the above)

A heart rate increase from horizontal(try to rest for at least 2-5 minutes to get resting heart rate)to standing (or as tested on a tilt table) of at least 30 beats per minute in adults, or at least 40 beats per minute in adolescents, measured during the first 10 minutes of standing and is sustained above the 30bpm increase after the initial rise.

*That means that even if it didnt rise immediately but within the 10 minute timeframe it counts but should be over the 30bpm after it ramps up and doesnt drop below the threshold.*

A persons resting heart rate ranges from 60-100 and upon standing the heart rate increases *up to 30+*beats per minute when standing up, and then it settles down again by 2 minutes. For people with postural tachycardia syndrome, the heart rate goes up considerably higher when they stand, often increasing 30 to 50 beats per minute or more and is sustained over the 30bpm within the 10 minute time frame.This can lead to lightheadedness, dizziness and fainting.

*The most important thing to note is that the HR is sustained above the +30/40 resting rate while standing and doesnt drop below*

~If your heart rate is still around +20/+25 and is still sustained over after two minutes you may still have Pots or some other form of dysautonomia or other condition and as always best to speak to your doctor about it.~

POTS is diagnosed only when orthostatic hypotension is ruled out and when there is no acute dehydration or blood loss. Orthostatic hypotension is a form of low blood pressure: 20mm Hg drop in systolic or a 10mm Hg drop in diastolic blood pressure in the first three minutes of standing upright.

I've never really had acid reflux life, however from Christmas morning until now it's been pretty constant.

I feel totally fine in the morning and by around mid afternoon I'm having acid reflux that will persist until I go to bed - I do feel fine when laying down.

sbu5mq,t5_2rtve,I often sense that doctors easily dismiss vague symptoms like these.,"[{""crowd-entity-annotation"":{""entities"":[]}}]","At what point did you decide to go and make an appointment with the rheumatologist?
I have been to a lot of doctors in the last year and a half. Someone (not a doctor) had suggested to me to make an appointment with a rheumatologist. But I wonder whether I should really do this if I am not in the midst of a flare up (of whatever it is I have). Because that's when blood tests would turn out with important information, right? 

The thing is, in the last year I have noticed that I sometimes just randomly (or not so randomly, maybe it is stress-related, too) get a low-grade fever (my body temperature is generally low, but I recently get days where it rises from 96.9 to 98.6). When this happens I also feel extremely fatigued, like I am going to get sick with the flu, my body feels heavy and aches. And my chest hurts sharply when I inhale. This has also happened occassionally. 

Soo, I wondered, at what point did you make an appointment with a rheumatologist? When did you say, well, this is not normal and weird?

First off- this sub has been so helpful in getting me educated on this.  You guys are awesome.

So about 2 weeks ago, I was at scout camp with my kid for the week with what I thought was tendinitis.  It was supposed to be a relaxing week for me to hike, and fish etc  while my kid worked on his merit badges.  Instead I was trapped in my tent for a week in crippling pain with what I know now was a gout attack.  

Initially my toe was a bit swollen.  Had I known it was gout, I could have avoided the food at the mess hall all week: red meat non stop among other just bad food choices.  I also ended up decreasing my water intake as I was stuck in a tent, and getting up and out to pee was extremely challenging.  You can guess what happened by the end of the week.  My entire foot was swollen.  Levels of swelling I'd never seen before...Fred Flintstone level foot.  I was in agony.

When I got home I ran to urgent care thinking I needed a brace.  I got the gout diagnosis, and was sent home on prednisone and colchicine.  I've since been eating clean, avoiding red meat/shellfish, and drinking a gallon of water a day.  I took my last Prednisone this past Sunday and my foot looks great.  The swelling is gone in my foot overall, however, my foot still feels crampy after all that trauma.  Yesterday,  I tried my sneakers on and I was surprised at how painful it was.  It wasn't the attack type of pain, but it hurt.  

How long does it take to fully recover from a full fledged week long attack?"

I completed my medication change from Oxcarbazepin to Lamotrigine already some weeks ago. Now my seizures mostly occur after nights with little sleep (which makes perfect sense). On Oxcarbazepin my sleep schedule didn't affect my seizures at all (or at least not that much), they were very random. Now I'm more sensitive to auditive triggers than before as well. My seizures are also more intense now on those specific days. Before the change, they were shorter and didn't really exhaust me as much as they do now. The side effects are much better now but on days without proper sleep they are guaranteed bad ones. I don't lose concience during any of my seizures but it's still annoying not to be able to finish my workouts because my brain goes bonkers. The new meds made my overall situation better but I feel like all the bs just shifts and doesn't want to go away no matter what you do. I know that I am lucky to have a mild form of epilepsy but the constant remider that you cannot do the things you want to do like working out or late night gaming with friends once in a while. Not without getting f'd over the next day. A proper sleep schedule would probably help me avoid some of those problems but working irregular shifts makes that quite impossible. Can't wait for better cannabis legalization in Germany to try and reduce my dosage. I know you all probably feel that frustration too. Not being allowed to drive, drink, mountainbiking isn't a good idea or fun either. Going to the gym helped me through the last months but now they're closed due to Covid. Feels like an endless journey trying to get at least a wee bit of relief."

Hey everyone. Long time lurker, first time poster. I was hoping I wouldnt have to join this group but my diagnosis was confirmed last week and here I am. I will say Im already grateful for this group and the wealth of knowledge and positivity here. 

So heres my dilemma: Im currently in limbo waiting to see a neurologist and get on a DMT, and feeling unsure what I should be doing for my covid booster. The wait time to see the neuro could be 1 - 8 weeks 
 
My concerns specifically:

- I still have symptoms from the relapse that led to my diagnosis. I dont know if this is considered an active relapse or my body is healing? Some symptoms have completely resolved, some improved, and some are the same.   The newest symptom onset was Dec. 26.

- I do want to get the booster ASAP due to omicron threat, and the fact that once Im on a DMT I wont get as good of an immune response 

- Im scared that the booster could cause another relapse but then again, I know covid would be worse 

- I had Pfizer for both first and second shots, minimal side effects (relapse did not happen until 4 months after second dose). I have the option to get Pfizer or Moderna. Im leaning toward Pfizer but would like to hear others thoughts and experiences  


Lastly, I understand the best thing for me to do is speak to a health care professional. I have, and the general guidance is to get the vaccine and either one is fine. However none of the professionals Ive talked to specialize in MS and so Im just looking for additional information/guidance/peace of mind from this community.

Hey guys, I'm hoping for some advice or stories here. 

My boyfriend was diagnosed at ~15 years old and is now 23. I am 22 and bought a house across the country. We are looking to move there, but I cannot solely provide for him should he be unable to find employment. 

COVID has been hard enough on job opportunities, but he has over a year gap in his resume and has been working part time retail jobs more recently. However, he feels like he might have a seizure now and then and this means he leaves work early. I fear they are cutting his hours because they don't see him as reliable. 

He's only had about one grand mal seizure every ~3 months, and that's because he listens to his body and rests when he needs to. 

Because of this, it looks like he doesn't qualify for federal disability benefits. They're not frequent enough, but his employers will continue to fire/cut hours until he's basically shadow-fired. 

What programs are there to help find employment? He's interested in IT, working from home at any capacity, or anything without too much physical labor. 

Are there any programs to give him a disability status that can be used to leverage more sick days at work?

If so, does it completely bar him from holding a driver's license? His seizures are well managed, but the dosages/meds he has needs tweaking since weight gain. He has gone almost a year before without seizures when he was thinner, so I'm hoping we can try and keep his rights to a license.

I've suffered from horrible gout since I was 23, I'm now 31. I get it in my fingers, toes, wrists, knees, and one elbow.

I take meds (allo and colchicine).

That being said, my Rheumatologist thinks that my kidneys and liver have a hard time clearing uric acid out of my blood rather than I ingest too many purines.

For this reason diet helps minimally .

A couple years back I heard a study in India doing full blood transfusions for people with sever gout and having some success.

So I started donating blood every 2 months(maximum times allowed). This helped quite a bit to manage my UA levels.

After reading that uric acid is carried  in the blood by plasma, I looked up plasma donation.

Plasma donation centers allow you donate 2x a week because they pull the plasma out of your blood, give you back your red blood cells, and then give you saline to replace the plasma.

Plus, they pay me $50 every time I donate, so I make an extra $400 a month.

That's besides the point, I would pay them to take my plasma because it seems to help reduce UA by straight up taking it out of my blood.

My flair ups have been much less frequent with no changes to my diet or medicine regimine.

NOTE I am not a medical professional. These is just my personal experience."

Ive only been on Ocrevus for about 6 months. I had my first infusion in September.

So today I got some routine blood work done. The lab reports came back showing I had very high WBC, high neutrophils absolute, and low lymphocytes. (Google says that it usually indicates the body is fighting an infection or the big C.)

I had just gotten my wisdom tooth removed yesterday and prior to that I was on antibiotics for about 2 weeks. I was having severe pain and discomfort prior to the tooth being removed(massive cavity/decay on that wisdom boy).

My concern comes from seeing those abnormal results, primarily in those fields(everything else was normal and in the green). Has anyone encountered abnormal blood results after being on Ocrevus? Or even after being on antibiotics while on Ocrevus?

I know theres always an increased risk of cancer when dealing certain medications, and that a high WBC is an indicator of such.

And if there have been similar situations with anyone.

I started doing the Wim Hof cold showers/ ice baths and breathing about 10 months ago after a coworker recommended it. Simply because they felt amazing because of it. In his book he talks about one of the main benefits as massively reducing the amount of inflammation in the body, which is the source of all sorts of chronic disease. He briefly touches on gout but hasnt really looked into it that much.  I figured it couldnt hurt though. 

Im not taking any prescriptions but do have a supply of indomethacin that I dip into if I have a nasty flare up. I historically have 2-3 a year with 1 usually being a monster. Most will last around a week but the big boys can go 3 weeks. 

Since I started the cold showers I havent changed my diet/alcohol at all and havent had a flair up. (If I do get a tingle in my feet, its usually after a weekend of excess, but its cleared after a shower or two.) That was until yesterday, when I got hit with an attack over night that made my foot feel like it was about to split apart.  I realized I had stopped the cold showers for the last few weeks. Probably because of the weather getting much colder and it can be hard to get motivated for a cold shower in the morning. 

That  being said, I did all the normal stuff: extra water, no booze, apple cider vinegar, and ibuprofen. (I also tried nettle tea for the first time which seemed to help) but also took an extra long cold shower and one today. And its like magic. I can walk with very minimal pain and feel like I might have dodged a bullet. 

The best part is that is friggen free! Youre going to be showering anyway just make the last few minutes as cold as it gets! Im not saying that it will work for everyone, but based on my experience Im convinced that its helping me. 

He has a few books out. I listened to his book on tape narrated by Apolo Ohno, the Olympic speed skater. The benefits go way beyond gout; he claims it helps anything from arthritis to cancer. Not that can cure cancer, but MAY help the symptoms and progression. 

I thought Id share the personal insight with other people that I really feel could benefit from it. 

TL;DR I believe that the Wim Hof Method  massively helped with my gout and might help you too!"

(Long)
Hi all,

So appreciative of this community existing; this is going to be a long post so bare with me and thank you in advance.



About 18 months ago, I was prescribed Fenofibrate due to extremely high triglyceride levels that have been a lifelong issue. 

About 6 months after that prescription of daily fenofibrate, I experienced my first gout attack on vacation. 

The pain was 9 out of 10, and at first I had no idea it was gout. I visited the ER thinking it was a broken toe; X-rays confirmed it wasnt, and after given some steroids for the swelling and painkillers, I was sent on my way. 

A few days later I went to urgent care and they estimated it was gout and I ended up going to my GP to seek treatment. 

My GP was great at describing everything and did the following:
- recommended I go on a gout diet
- recommended I stopped drinking (I was having about 4-6 glasses of wine a week - thanks pandemic!)
- prescribed a daily dose of 100mg Allopurinol
- prescribed Colchicine for acute flare ups
- prescribed Indomethacine for acute flare ups

I did everything I was told, and for 8 months I was mostly fine, with two exceptions:
1. The once a month Id have a single drink, I would turn flush. Possibly from liver function side effects from Fenofibrate?
2. My toe never was 100% normal, but there was no pain and it was 95% normal in appearance. 


Ok, all caught up?


2 months ago, I had a flare up of gout. Nothing major, but some toe pain in the 3/10 range. It passed after a few days. Not sure of the trigger event. 


This week however, I had a gout attack in my elbow and the pain has been excruciating. Easily 9/10 pain levels. 

The two possible triggers are:
1. Ive been under a lot of recent stress 
2. I had 2 beers in 3 days

My question, is it possible my gout is being caused by Fenofibrate?

One of the side effects of Fenofibrate is decreased kidney functions - specifically the increase of serum creatinine levels. [here](http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/815413)


When googling, theres medical tests that seemingly confirm high serum creatinine levels can raise uric acid: [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1004629/)

I'm not on allo (...yet...might be very soon) and I bought a UA test kit just to see what I could learn about my levels. In the 10 days I have had it, my UA has ranged from 5.3 to 8.6, with most readings between 6 and 7.

Hello, I dont post often but stumbled upon this wonderful subreddit last night as I couldnt sleep due to the pain.

Im M/27 and overweight/heavy drinker. After getting married a few months ago I decided it was time for some changes and went to my PD for the first time in years. Had gained about 80lbs since going when I was 21 and told the doctor I had been drinking about 6/7 days. My liver enzymes were about 3 times elevated. In the weeks since then Ive lost about 10 pounds and had quit drinking on weekdays and doing moderate exercise/eating a much healthy diet(which did include a lot of chicken and fish)

About two weeks ago I woke up thinking I had broken my ankle. After suffering for a few days I went to urgent care thinking I had a blood clot or something and they told me it was gout. Prescribed me prednisone and hydrocodone. I started feeling better within a day and was pretty much back to normal by the following week. 

However I have another flare up now and cant walk again. Im trying to go to see my PD because Im not sure if I should really be taking prednisone and hydrocodone with my high liver enzymes. Ive seen a lot of talk about colchicine and allopurinal. Just wondering if anyone else has similar experiences and knows if these would be better for me. Also, Im guessing cutting back to weekend only drinking is not going to be enough to stop the attacks.

Thanks Im advance"

Does creatine cause flares or exacerbate urate crystal buildup?

**UPDATE: Question answered YES:**

>THE RELATION BETWEEN CREATINE AND GOUT
>Based on scientific research, the relation between creatine and gout is fairly simple to explain. Creatine  as well as foods high in creatine  will overwhelm the body with purines  the primary cause of gout. As a result, the creatine supplementation will inevitably increase the levels of uric acid and the probability to develop gout. The same effects will target men with or without gout. Creatine can cause flareups in those with gout, but it can also cause gout in those without it.

>On the same note, if you take a creatine supplement and you experience gout, you need to cease the supplementation and discuss it with your doctor.

>Bottom line, there is a very solid relation between creatine and gout. Just like you research labels to find foods with no purines whatsoever, you should do the same for supplements  and creatine is highly contraindicated. Even if you do not experience flareups while taking creatine or you do not have gout, chances are the high levels of uric acid will take you there at some point or another.

About 11 weeks into my pregnancy I started experiencing tingling/numbness on my left side and went into the doctor, thinking it was pregnancy related. They sent me to the ER to have imaging done, where they found lesions in my brain. I had a lumbar puncture done that confirmed an MS diagnosis, as well as additional MRIs on my spine that were inconclusive because they can't use contrast when you're pregnant.

My neurologist recommended I start Copaxone, but my OB doesn't want me to start it during pregnancy so I am holding off for now (with neurologist's okay). Every doctor I've seen tells me MS goes into remission/goes away during pregnancy, which has not been reassuring as I received my diagnosis in pregnancy. My flare ups have been manageable and the pain is limited. I'm actually flare up free currently (finally) which gives me hope that it is subsiding the more pregnant I get (currently 24 weeks).

I kind of just needed to vent, because adjusting to this diagnosis has been hard. There is so much uncertainty ahead and that scares me. 

I also wanted to ask if anyone has had experience breastfeeding while on Copaxone. I had planned on starting it after delivery, but my OB posed the question of if it's safe to take while breastfeeding (which I hadn't even thought about). I am waiting for my referral to an MS specialist, but I know there isn't a lot of research on the topic. Did anyone breastfeed on Copaxone? 

I'm also nervous about future pregnancies. This is our first and my husband and I want three kids, but now I'm not sure what is feasible - i.e. going off of MS meds if/when I try to get pregnant, what that might do to my body. I know my specialist will be able to ease some of these questions, but they have been weighing so heavily on me I wanted to see if anyone here has experience with this. I also know it's different for everyone, especially because I don't know what my body will be like/be capable of after pregnancy.

I've been experiencing very bad constipation. If/when  I do have a BM it's very loose. The cramping and stomach pains are quite bad when I'm unable to have a BM for a little while. My team have recommended miralax which I've been taken twice daily. I've also done two large flushes (peglyte)of my system. However, I never feel fully clear.

It seems that some folks need to adjust enzyme once starting trikafts. I've maintained my normal amount of 3-4 creon 25 with meals, 1-2 with snacks. I think my next move is to reduce them and see if that works.

s1lu1x,t5_2saq9,". My primary doctor said that if the echocardiogram results came back normal, which they did, then she is pretty confident that I may have POTs. However, my cardiologist never mentioned POTs and didnt sound too worried about my symptoms, and my primary doctor doesnt think I need to be tested any further.
","[{""crowd-entity-annotation"":{""entities"":[]}}]","Where to go from here? Likely have POTs. Heart is fine but still worried about high heart rate.

Hello!

So my doctor seems to think I (24F) have POTs but Im not getting a tilt table test done. I didnt push for it but should I?

A little backstory: I began experiencing symptoms last year and have even seen a cardiologist because in the beginning, I was convinced it was my heart that was the problem. Thankfully thats not the case. Ive had my heart checked (holter monitor, EKGs and most recently an echocardiogram). My primary doctor said that if the echocardiogram results came back normal, which they did, then she is pretty confident that I may have POTs. However, my cardiologist never mentioned POTs and didnt sound too worried about my symptoms, and my primary doctor doesnt think I need to be tested any further.

Ive always wondered if I had a bad circulation problem but never had any extreme symptoms until the middle of 2021. The very first sign that something as off was when I noticed my fingernails turned blue after a workout, but they quickly returned to normal. This would happen again randomly but not very often. 

Next, I began noticing purple/red-ish hands and feet/legs after standing in the shower. Around this time I also started having dull chest pains and shortness of breath accompanied by a high heart rate anytime Id stand and walk. Part of this I thought was due to some anxiety, because I began worrying something was wrong with my heart. It still gets very high. At rest, lying horizontally, my resting heart rate will be in the 80s on a good day, but rise to 120-130 easily upon standing and walking. Im afraid to start working out again even though my doctor has said its okay to because I feel like it could easily get to 200 or more.

My doctor has also advised me how to manage my symptoms and gave me propranolol to take when needed, but Im still concerned about my heart despite the tests coming back ok. Just today, I challenged myself to a a walk down the street to lunch and back, and after walking up a few stairs, my heart rate on my Apple Watch reached 194. I know everything is physically ok with my heart but this still worries me.  

So now what do I do? Im guessing its time to just manage my symptoms and get on with life but Im still scared my heart will just give out eventually or something. Ive looked at my previous heart data months prior to developing more of the symptoms and was is still really high, I guess I just never thought about it. Maybe its also due to me not being as in shape as I used to. I just cant stop thinking about it."

Is there a diet that substantially helped with symptoms? I know it cant take it away but Im willing to try and change to anything if it alleviates even a small amount of it.

Are there other life changes or adjustments you made that have been worth the effort? I have spoken with quite a few people that deal with autoimmune disorders but no one that specifically had Lupus.

They had me lay down on a table, immediately took me blood pressure and HR, then told me to stand, and immediately took my blood pressure and HR again and said well theres no difference in your HR or BP. Im fairly certain that isnt an accurate test for POTS but I didnt argue with them. I also have days where I feel fine and days where just standing to cook some food feels like running a marathon. Of course the day they did the test I felt fine.

I guess my question is how did you get diagnosed with POTS? What symptoms do you experience from having POTS? I also have read that POTS is usually triggered by an accident or severe illness, but I think its something Ive always had.

I feel discouraged from seeking further medical advice because it really doesnt seem like they care. And now Im questioning whether its actually POTS or if I just naturally have a higher HR and am fatigued all the time because of stress or anxiety.. I dont know..

Edit: I just want to add that I feel like I know very little about POTS or any other conditions that it could be. By browsing through the other posts here I think I might be a mild case or borderline possibly? I havent fainted from standing since I was a teenager, but mostly because I know my limits now and will sit if Im having a bad day or can feel myself becoming faint. My HR when standing is usually around 120-130 and laying down between 60-70."

I had my first gout attack in my early 20's and was able to avoid future flare-ups for a while via changing my diet and taking 1.8 mg colchicine upon (suspected) onset of symptoms. I'm otherwise healthy, active and fit, but because every male relative on both sides of my family has suffered from gout, I knew it would only be a matter of time until the lifestyle changes were not sufficient. I had no attacks for about 7 years, but I've since had 2 flare-ups in the last 6 months. I told myself that I'd start Allo if I began having >1 attack per year, so now I intend to do so. 

I've read that one should be clear of gout symptoms before starting UA-lowering therapy, and while I can now put on shoes, walk, etc, I still have some residual pain in both big toe joints from my two most recent attacks. I recall that the lingering pain from my first attack didn't clear completely for nearly a year.

Interestingly skin lupus (cutaneous lupus) tended to improve after infection.

However, antiphospholipid antibodies overall did not increase. This is important, as we know COVID infection can cause deadly blood clots (so not surprising).

Still, my doctors have been very reluctant to prescribe allopurinol as a preventative measure since I don't suffer often enough. After a *lot* of pushing, however, I managed to persuade my doctor to write a ""just in case"" prescription of colchicine to have on hand should I ever need it.

Last time this happened he wrote me a prescription for 6 pills. I took 3, and it ended a month-long flareup in two days. So I was definitely a fan. This just-in-case script was for 60 pills. To just have on hand. (Only cost me $30 without even having a drug plan - so grateful to live in this country!)

So yesterday I woke up and, while the pain hadn't started, the swelling was undeniable. A flareup was starting.

Around 2pm I took a pill, and another an hour later. Woke up today, ZERO signs of gout!

Hi all,

I have had MS for maybe 10 years and never got an attack since the first one that brought the diagnose.

I have been incredibly lucky and dont feel much, from time to time a foot that might buzz a little, some of you have probably tried that. I feel super healthy, can run 10k etc., but I feel I get sick pretty frequently during the winter season, which is pretty annoyning.

I figured it might have something to do with the fact that I do take immunosuppressive medicine (Aubagio/Teriflunomide) - I dont feel any side effects from the small pill, but what if I stopped taking it?

I know no one can tell me what will happen, maybe the medicine is the reason why I am not getting any attacks etc., but maybe some of you have been in a similar situation? Has anyone you know stopped taking medicine, what happened, and would there be any good reason to think I might get less sick during winter?

I usually get these small flu-like situations, where I feel pretty bad like something is coming up and then it pretty quickly goes away. Or a sore throat or something similar - I often get these at least 5 times during the winter season (from memory).

I guess a hybrid model could also be considered, where I simply only took the medicine for the warmest 6 months of the year? I live in Scandinavia, so weather is not great usually.

Thanks for the support from such an awesome community, would appreciate any feedback on any of this.

I did try talking to my doctor about this, he simply said ""we don't recommend this"" <-- no big surprise there to be honest :-)...

Does creatine cause flares or exacerbate urate crystal buildup?

**UPDATE: Question answered YES:**

>THE RELATION BETWEEN CREATINE AND GOUT
>Based on scientific research, the relation between creatine and gout is fairly simple to explain. Creatine  as well as foods high in creatine  will overwhelm the body with purines  the primary cause of gout. As a result, the creatine supplementation will inevitably increase the levels of uric acid and the probability to develop gout. The same effects will target men with or without gout. Creatine can cause flareups in those with gout, but it can also cause gout in those without it.

>On the same note, if you take a creatine supplement and you experience gout, you need to cease the supplementation and discuss it with your doctor.

>Bottom line, there is a very solid relation between creatine and gout. Just like you research labels to find foods with no purines whatsoever, you should do the same for supplements  and creatine is highly contraindicated. Even if you do not experience flareups while taking creatine or you do not have gout, chances are the high levels of uric acid will take you there at some point or another.

Hi All,

I'm still relatively new here and looking to get some input on my specific situation. 27M. Last year I had an episode of numbness and tingling on my left side (arm and leg). It went away after about 4 days, but the incident kick-started a long line of tests which ended up in my MS diagnosis. I have 6-8 demyelinating brain lesions visible on MRI. All spinal MRIs were clear. I saw an MS specialist who said that only spinal lesions would cause symptoms in the extremities. This means that my MS lesions in my brain did not cause my numbness/tingling and have not caused any symptoms yet. The doctor said that because of this, treatment can be delayed, and I would be monitored every six months or so with an MRI. This is an MS specialist doctor with a reputable clinic.

Is there any merit to this approach in your view? Obviously the idea of delaying these medications is appealing, but I also know it's playing with fire. It's frustrating because in general I have always been averse to taking medication, so what this doctor said what pretty much what I wanted to hear. I don't want to be unwise and risk unneeded damage, but I also wonder if this is in fact radiologically isolated syndrome, which to my understanding *is* supposed to be monitored before treatment starts. I'm just a little stuck on this. 

Any insight or input would be much appreciated. Thank you guys."

Hi gang. Im wondering if anyone has experienced a relapse that does not show new lesion activity on MRI? I had my scans at the beginning of Feb and all is stable (yay!). But I started having some weakness in my arm around the same time and it was a bit insidious in that it was kind of slow to come on and then got worse quite quickly. I had been having sensory issues in that arm for so long (neuro aware) but I had a disc issue in my c spine last year so I chalked it up to that. My MRI shows that disc issue is fully resolved and back its vertebrae house (also yay!). But my left arm and hand are very weak and it has spread across my shoulders. I also have spasticity in my left armpit, my ribcage is in pain and feels tight. My specialist is not convinced that what is happening right now is mechanical, which was my assumption and why I waited to report the symptoms until my arm was so weak that I couldnt really function very well. Which in hindsight, I should have called earlier. I just assumed it was my neck and upper back acting up and that it would get better. I really struggle sometimes determining what is just my back being my back and what is related to MS. 

I feel pretty confused by all of this because I dont have any lesions in my spinal cord showing on an MRI and nothing new in my brain, though for some reason they didnt use contrast this time for any of my scans and perhaps something small was missed in my spine? My specialist is concerned that based on my symptom presentation and the exam that my spinal cord is inflamed and that I am having a relapse. He said that MRIs cannot see everything and it doesnt pick up small lesions or all of the inflammation that is happening in the CNS. He has prescribed me a course of the devils tictacs (steroids ) to take to try and speed things up and reduce symptoms. 

Has this happened to any of you before where your MRI looked stable with no progression but you were having a relapse? I googled and I found a lot about this happening in SPMS or PPMS but I am still fairly early in my disease as per my neuro.

Hope you guys all have a nice weekend.

Hello everyone! Im 20 F and suffering from a weak esophagus and 3 cm hiatal hernia. I am receiving the toupet fundoplication tomorrow morning. Im ready to be able to eat pizza with my friends and not writhe trying to sleep later, or be able to look under my bed for something without bile leaking into my mouth. 

Ive been through lots of testing and its been determined I REALLY need this surgery. My grandmother actually had the same surgery done by the same surgeon 2 years ago and shes doing amazing, so Im hoping for good outcomes! 

I have to say, I am very nervous about recovery. I know its not good to do this but of course I looked for other peoples opinions and experiences and Ive seen people saying they got worse after surgery, or that the pain was unbearable and they werent normal for months and months afterward. Im a naturally overthinking and anxious person, so any advice or words of encouragement would be so appreciated!!!

Ill update tomorrow afterwards when I can and tell you all my experience :))

UPDATE #1: 

Hi guys! Ive been post-op I think around 8-10 hours Im not sure, but we started about 2.5 hrs late cuz of a delay with his other patient. I was told the surgery went well and everything was successful. Yay! When I woke up I was very out of it but I will warn you all, its probably different for everyone, but the pain from the gas they pump in was excruciating. Definitely a 9 on the pain scale. Its already gone down to maybe a 4, but it was the worst pain Ive ever felt for a little while there. None of the pain came from the actual surgery so thats good and bad in my opinion haha.

Its about 2 am where Im at and Ive been sleeping on and off. Ive had the tiniest bit of water and lukewarm chicken broth which was actually amazing lmao. Theyve had to give me lots of good pain meds and some nausea meds occasionally but other than that Ive been fine. Ive been up to the bathroom 3 times and it gets easier every time. However, it is a little strange to pee cuz you can feel your stomach spam a little!! (It doesnt hurt at all and you can barely feel it, its just weird!) 

I cant really bend down yet at all and I still have some dull achy pain in my shoulders but hopefully that will subside soon. Ill let you guys know any other updates I have!!!

MINI UPDATE: 
Hey guys. Woke up around 4:30 and the shoulder pain was back. 5:30 got more morphine. Morphine is nice. Still hurts like a bitch tho


**UPDATE 8/20/2022**
Hey everyone. I am so sorry I never continued updating this thread. I switched reddit accounts so I never even saw how many people were asking about my experience! Here's what I can tell you after about 8 months.

The recovery was HARD. Very very difficult, but worth it. It was about 3 months before I got back to eating completely normally, but since then I've only had 2 or 3 episodes of something getting stuck, and it usually passes within minutes, and even those 2 or 3 happened months ago. Something not a lot of people talk about with the recovery is lack of energy. It was probably a month or more before I had enough energy to not nap at all during the day, and it was about until I could eat completely normally that I had a normal amount of energy.

The pain with the recovery was pretty intense for the first week or so, then eventually subsided. The shoulder pain from the gas right after the surgery was some of the worst pain I've ever experienced in my life, but it gets a lot better once you walk it off. However, that was difficult too. It was pretty difficult to do literally anything other than lay down or sit up on pillows and sleep. I had to have help sitting up for about a week. All of this stuff from the first week, however, subsided pretty quickly as I started to be able to get back to normal life.

Since I woke up from the surgery, I haven't had a single GERD/acid reflux issue. The surgery DOES work (for most and for me), and it DOES work IMMEDIATELY. It was life changing. I didn't even know most people's stomach didn't burn painfully when they were hungry; I thought that was normal until after this surgery.

As for weight loss, I weighed about 177 when I got the surgery, and now I weigh about 130. Most of the weight loss can be attributed to this surgery and the liquid diet and eating much smaller portions because your stomach is a third smaller, however in my personal experience I also started taking a stimulant Vyvanse for my ADHD which makes me eat a LOT less and also have impulse control over my snacking. I still believe you will lose a good bit of weight just from the surgery alone no matter who you are because of the liquid diet and eating smaller portions (ESPECIALLY the smaller portions, I can hardly eat anything at one time anymore, but I am hungry more times in a day because of this).

What I want everyone to know about this surgery that not a lot of people talk about is that, in my experience, it is more of a trade-off than a fix. Yes, I haven't had a single issue with GERD since I woke up afterward, but I also have not been able to expel gas from my system or have a normal bowel movement since then either. I have been taking the absolute maximum strength Gas X and Metamucil every morning and every night since my last surgery follow up appointment because these issues never got better. If I miss one dose of either of these supplements, it will take 2 days or more to get regular again. And the supplements don't completely fix it. I also eat very very small amounts, which was nice at first cuz I needed to lose weight, but now that I'm at a healthy weight it's kinda aggravating eating such small amounts many times a day to satiate hunger, but that's probably the least significant issue I've had.

Another thing I've encountered that I haven't heard much about is sugar intolerance. I have a much harder time consuming sugar now, especially in drinks. I can't drink any drink with any more than maybe 20% of your daily value of sugar because it hurts my stomach so bad. I just turned 21 in February and I have come to terms with the fact that my drink choices are very limited due to the fact that carbonation and sugar make me sick. Simple syrup, for example, will make my stomach hurt so bad I have to go home and go to bed if I even have just a few sips. It sucks, but it's worth it to have to make some lifestyle changes to get rid of the acid reflux. I will say though, the carbonation issues have gotten less and less as time has gone on. I can even drink seltzers now (as long as they don't have lots of sugar, of course). 

I am also unable, of course, to vomit. I haven't had anything come up at all since then. It's tried a few times though, and let me tell you, it sucks! In my personal experience, the few times my body has tried to make me throw up, I've been stuck retching for up to an hour or more. It's very painful, and it will keep going for a long time. I contracted a stomach virus a few months ago and had to go to the hospital because I kept uncontrollably retching to the point I couldn't breathe and almost passed out. It was very scary, but that was only 1 time, and after that I asked for a stronger anti-nausea pill (I take Zofran now) and I have it on me AT ALL TIMES, just like my inhaler. I'd suggest if you feel at all like you might be sick, TAKE IT! Other than those few times though, the inability to throw up hasn't been much of a issue.

Oh, also as a side note, I still can't lift things that are very heavy/awkward without it hurting the site. Also the scars healed up pretty well. Still visible of course, but I'm covered in scars from being a wild child and working in a kitchen (lol) so I don't really care about them, but for anyone that does, I don't think they go away for a while.

Overall, I'm very very glad, even/especially at my young age, that I chose to have this surgery. I was in so much pain and couldn't do a lot of things normal people my age could because it hurt me so bad/made me sick. I couldn't sleep without my whole bed being propped up, I couldn't eat 4 hours before bed, I couldn't eat anything spicy or tomato without completely regretting it later, etc. It absolutely changed my life. The recovery was hell, I had to make some lifestyle changes, I still can't do some things ""normal"" people my age can do, but it's worlds better than what I was dealing with. I could immediately sleep at any elevation without it burning and choking on bile. I can eat pretty much any food I want (except for much sugar, but that's okay). I can eat right before bed if I want, I can eat spicy food all day long, I can eat Mexican, etc.! I have so much more freedom! It still does cost 1. money of course, and 2. still a little freedom. You have to be careful to take care of it well. You want it to last as long as possible, and you don't want to hurt yourself.

I'm so sorry this update didn't come out sooner. I hope this can help many many people in making a decision!!! Peace and love to all my GERD homies <3

**TL;DR: I'm very happy with my decision to go through with the surgery and most people would benefit from it I believe. However, there are many trade-offs/nuances I wish I had been more aware of. My quality of life is worlds better after this surgery and I would encourage everyone who qualifies to discuss it with your doctors and specialists, and don't be afraid of the recovery. It's so worth it!**"

I wanted to start this with letting you all know that my anxiety is TERRIBLE and has controlled my life for 20 plus years now.
Ive read tons and tons of posts regarding this but I thought Id tell my story and get some information regarding it. 
This all started about a week ago, I read something about how Pantoprazole has some long term effects on your body that honestly arent too stellar so I decided to just stop taking it (I was taking 40mg Pantoprazole once a day or twice if needed)
Anyway, during this time Ive been feeling the WORST symptoms Ive ever experienced. Tons of acid in my throat, stomach and chest pain, nausea, diarrhea, constipation. But the worst thing that was happening to me is / was the fluttering in my chest or palpitations possibly? Id have a major flair up and the palpitations would continue every 20 seconds or so for a few minutes. 
Now this made my anxiety INSANE and I was constantly having panic attacks due to it. It was a bit of a vicious cycle where symptoms were bad, anxiety was bad and it continued like that for what felt like HOURS.
Today I decided to get back on my PPI because honestly nothing is worth that pain. 

Does anyone have advice? How do you control your anxiety during times like this? Do you experience flare Ups like this ever?"

In October, my uric acid level was 9.1 mg/dL. I started taking these supplements closer to the beginning of November, along with 10,000 IUs of vitamin D & 200 mcgs of K2 per day. I had my levels remeasured this week and my uric acid is now at 8.0 mg/dL. In my opinion, this is a significant improvement from supplements on their own. I would like to hear any thoughts or suggestions. 

Being that Im only 22, I prefer avoiding long-term medications like Allopurinol. I will remeasure my levels in another 3 months and provide an update at that time. 

In addition to supplements, I have completely cut my refined carbohydrate and sugar intake. I believe that the byproducts from sugar/high fructose corn syrup and refined carbohydrates causes more uric acid production than that of animal meat. Sugar and refined carbs also cause dehydration, which in turn, promotes the buildup of uric acid. Over the past 2 years, my poor diet has consisted of an incomprehensible amount of sugar and refined carbs because of fast food consumption, (often multiple times per day). I have insulin resistance, (high insulin promotes more uric acid production), low vitamin D, and a vitamin B deficiency. 

With a very strict diet and the continuation of these supplements, I am hopeful that I can lower my uric acid to normal levels. Additionally, I was instructed by a urologist/kidney surgeon to consume large amounts of alkaline water as a simple solution to my uric acid problem. I will test his theory over the next few months."

It disappeared within minutes, and soon after I got a splitting headache that knocked me out for the rest of the day. When I recovered that evening, I first noticed I had Lhermitte's sign, which led to my MS diagnosis.

I've been on a DMA ever since, and got no new lesions in 5 years.

Following the same pattern, an incapacitating headache followed less than an hour later.
I don't think I have new symptoms after that migraine, but I have an MRI scheduled very soon and I'll be able to tell if I got new lesions.

Does creatine cause flares or exacerbate urate crystal buildup?

**UPDATE: Question answered YES:**

>THE RELATION BETWEEN CREATINE AND GOUT
>Based on scientific research, the relation between creatine and gout is fairly simple to explain. Creatine  as well as foods high in creatine  will overwhelm the body with purines  the primary cause of gout. As a result, the creatine supplementation will inevitably increase the levels of uric acid and the probability to develop gout. The same effects will target men with or without gout. Creatine can cause flareups in those with gout, but it can also cause gout in those without it.

>On the same note, if you take a creatine supplement and you experience gout, you need to cease the supplementation and discuss it with your doctor.

>Bottom line, there is a very solid relation between creatine and gout. Just like you research labels to find foods with no purines whatsoever, you should do the same for supplements  and creatine is highly contraindicated. Even if you do not experience flareups while taking creatine or you do not have gout, chances are the high levels of uric acid will take you there at some point or another.

>The researchers were from Monash University and led by Professor Sam El-Osta who said that while the gene implicated in POTS  norepinephrine transporter (NET)  had been known for several decades, past research had failed to find a genetic mutation responsible for the symptoms. This latest study revealed that the enzyme EZH2 is responsible for silencing this gene.

>""We predicted that inhibiting this epigenetic condition could reactivate NET gene function and used a pharmacological drug called GSK-126 that could specifically inhibit EZH2 activity with dramatic results, Professor Sam El-Osta said. This is the first description of NET reactivation using a drug. The beauty is that it allows us to target very specifically the enzyme to reactivate gene function.

>Currently there is no specific pharmacological treatment available for POTS, which affects mainly people aged 18 to 50 years, 80 percent of whom are women. Were far from it now and clinical trials would need to be conducted, but the new drug could lead to better management of POTS, he continued.

>Professor El-Ostas team conducted ex vivo studies isolating blood cells from patients with POTS who failed to respond to current treatments and cells from healthy donors. He said the sample group was relatively small: Ideally, wed like to see the work expanded in Australia and overseas and to have our findings validated.

The study was published in the American Heart Association journal *[Circulation Research](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.119.315654).*

Moderna announces first participant dosed in phase 1 study of its mRNA Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) vaccine.

Moderna expects to enrol approximately 270 participants in the U.S.

EBV is a major cause of infectious mononucleosis, which can debilitate patients for weeks to months; there is no approved vaccine to prevent EBV

EBV can also lead to lifelong medical conditions and is associated with an increased risk of developing multiple sclerosis, certain lymphoproliferative disorders, cancers, and autoimmune diseases.



**Prof. Giovannoni:**

*After reviewing the epidemiological data about the association between EBV and MS in the late nineties I become convinced that EBV is the cause of MS. One of the reasons why I moved academic institutions, from UCL to Queen Mary University of London, was to study EBV and to develop an MS prevention research programme. Despite being very positive I found that it was difficult to convince my colleagues and the wider MS community to invest in EBV-MS research. I was fortunate enough to get an MRC grant application, but since then I must have had at least 20 grant applications around the EBV-MS hypothesis rejected. It is very disheartening when this happens.*

*The good news is that in 2017 Professor Nick Wald, Director of the Wolfson Institute of Preventive Medicine, suddenly realised that the evidence I had presented to him in 2007 was stronger than he had appreciated and agreed with me that EBV was the likely cause of MS. This lead us to hold a workshop on EBV and MS and led to a successful grant application to the Barts Charity to start the Preventive Neurology Unit (PNU).*

***I am often asked why has no MS preventative action been taken? I need to remind people that science moves steadily and slowly and the biggest problem we have is the slow adoption, or rejection, of innovations or new ideas.***

*However, we are pushing on slowly with our plans to create a trial-ready cohort of people at high risk of MS for exploratory MS prevention studies. Dr Ruth Dobson is doing an amazing job at getting this off the ground. We are also taking forward our ideas around treating MS with antivirals that target EBV. To say that the funding for doing these trials has been difficult is an understatement, but I am hoping if we can get pilot data we can convince the sceptics to fund larger more definitive trials.*

*I cant tell how excited I am that Modernas EBV vaccine has entered phase 1 trials and they have openly acknowledged that if it gets to the general public the vaccine may prevent MS. This statement alone is momentous. Why? If we can convince pharma of the importance of the EBV hypothesis maybe we can now convince funders to support a large international MS prevention study.*

*Even if Moderna proves that their EBV vaccine is effective in preventing EBV infection and infectious mononucleosis we will still have to overcome the public resistance to vaccination and convince public health officials that using EBV vaccination to prevent MS is a worthy objective. The battles ahead are numerous, but we will get there in the end. We have to. We dont want the next generation of pwMS asking us why we havent done anything to prevent MS given the current state of knowledge.*

Hello!  Im a guy with MS who has previously had low testosterone numbers pre-dx (eg below 12 nmol/L).  Ive been feeling especially crappy lately (low energy stuff).  So rather than just accept its MS, I dove into the rabbit hole of trying to find why I feel crappy and came across something interesting that may affect others in here.

Since my dx, Ive been taking supplements to help control my MS.  And my regime and DMT have worked.  My MS went from highly active at dx to NEDA now.  One thing I do every day is I take a flax seed oil + curcumin capsule.

Flax seed oil reduces relapses by 60% according to this study by Dr Jelinik (of OMS diet):

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3821380/

Awesome.  I am only taking 1x1000mg capsule daily- not a lot.  However, apparently when taking with curcumin + piperine, absorption is increased.  

Now, back to me feeling crappy.  I went to an endocrinologist, described symptoms I was having, and she sent me for a blood panel.  It came back with a ridiculously high testosterone number.  Like almost 30 nmol/L - an unnatural number for my age and totally inconsistent with my prior panel.  I should be rocking a massive erection constantly.  But instead, its barely even just okay.  Likewise with body hair, I dont have very much.  And Im hardly very muscular either.  Somethings not right with that number.

So I started reading and found an association between flax seed oil and testosterone that fit:

The reason that flaxseeds are on the hit list for raising testosterone is because they are rich in lignans, which tend to mimic estrogen in the body. Since estrogen is the opposing sex hormone to testosterone, the more of it you have (particularly if you are a man), the more low testosterone-like symptoms youll have. (from: https://www.shawacademy.com/blog/6-foods-to-avoid-to-optimise-natural-testosterone/ )

Also its discussed at length in setting of PCOS at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2752973/

Whats interesting is, testosterone is associated with a neuroprotective effect in MS.  (from: https://www.mdedge.com/multiplesclerosishub/article/134428/multiple-sclerosis/testosterone-affects-outcomes-men-ms ).

The effect of estrogen-mimicking lignans fits as a culprit for feeling crappy in a hypogonadism sense - but it also seems to fit the unexplained data from Dr Jeliniks study showing how much more effective flax seed oil was compared to other Omega-3s, since lignans are a unique element not found in fish oils.

If only that Omega-3 study had an endocrine panel, this theory might be solved.  It seems like tapering down flax seed oil intake would help me feel better- but could also reduce beneficial effect of the high testosterone on my MS.

Not sure which path to take.  But an interesting set of associations!  If any smart person has any guidance or this is all wrong, would be helpful!"

I was referred to a new internalist who just finished her schooling last year and told me today that she doesn't think I have lupus, raynuads and thinks I just damaged my meniscus ( my doctor before her mentioned meniscus and that is a place that hurts, but I know the pain from this feels WAY different than the stiff, aching feeling in my knees.) My grandmother had lupus and was diagnosed on her deathbed. She suffered a 3 hour seizure, her brain had shrunk and she had cirrhosis of the liver. Years prior to this she would swell up huge in her ankles and knees and feet, she also had the butterfly rash. When telling the doctor this she told me ""those aren't usual lupus symptoms, swelling was probably from the cirrhosis of liver"", which is true but clearly that all happened from untreated lupus!!!! In fact the doctor who diagnosed me is the one who diagnosed my grandmother. Anyway, she had also told me my hands were eczema (could be but I've never had eczema and this had gotten progressively worse as my symptoms got worse earlier in the year). I asked her if it's not lupus what could this be and she said probably just damaged knee, didn't have any other ideas.i could tell she didn't believe me, thought I was over exaggerating.  WHAT ABOUT ALL THE OTHER SYMPTOMS? Does my meniscus affect everything else I'm experiencing???? Ugh. I am just frustrated and don't know what to do. She sent me off with blood work to test if I have lupus ( ANA test was positive) and said come back in 3 months. I'm so upset I just want to feel better and not be in pain."

 A research team led by Dr. Marcus Koch and Dr. Wee Yong (Co-Founder and Chief Scientific Officer of AnthoBio) at the University of Calgary that investigates a generic drug, hydroxychloroquine, in primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) recently published its clinical study results in Annals of Neurology. The study followed 35 PPMS patients over a period of five years. Throughout the study, 14 patients were expected to develop a significant reduction in their walking function. However, only 8 patients had experienced a reduction by the end of the study. Thats almost a 50% reduction in the number of PPMS patients negatively affected by continuing disability. Although the results will require confirmation in a larger trial, this study has shown that hydroxychloroquine could help slow down the disability progression of PPMS. This study opens the possibility for future treatment option for PPMS and the researchers hope their work will inspire future larger scale clinical research on the drug for PPMS.

On thursday, I had my second Tonic Clonic seizure in less than two months. I'm T1D and my blood sugars went low. I remember having my Myoclonic seizures which are just muscle jerks, and I took some sugar and was on my phone, sitting on the floor in our basement, with my siblings, waiting for my numbers to come up. The next thing I remember was passing out and then waking up to some random dudes in our basement, and my step mother helping me stand up. Turns out, I went unconsious and had a tonic clonic seizure, then started acting like a tired wacko once they kind of got my attention, without me remembering it, so my step mother called an ambulance. The dudes in our basement were paramedics and firemen (Idk why the firemen showed up, but thats who my step brother they said showed up). I ended up going into the ambulance where a lady was driving, the guy was trying to talk to me to make sure I was alright, and my step mother grabbed me some food and a T-shirt because I bit my tongue when I fell face first and I had blood on my sweater, and she came in the ambulance with me (Her mother was there to watch the other kids). So I was in a hospital that I'm usually taken to for this stuff, and they were giving me sugar stuff through an IV. My step mother stayed with me until my mom came to swap out with her (Only one parent allowed in per patient at a time). I ended up getting out at 2am on friday and my mom drove me back to my step mother's house to get some sleep. 

Apparently while I was being a wacko, I latched onto my step mother's arm and she had to pry me off, and then I just randomlt pulled at her pants. 

Apparently my 3yo half sister was there, somehow knows what a seizure is, and will tell you that I had a seizure and will tell you the sounds I make during those seizures. My muscles are sore as hell, but now I might get a reason out of gym lmao.

Hi
I was curious if anyone else here has tried an anti-inflammatory diet for managing gout. I got my first attack in February and was following the advice of avoiding high purine foods. I found something on YouTube which talked about inflammation being the main culprit behind gout flare ups. The guy on that video was suggesting a keto diet which I haven't done. I've mostly tried to cut out a lot of extra carbs and really limit my alcohol intake. I've been taking turmeric and lots of ginger, as well. It seems to have worked, until a couple days ago I started to feel a flare up after a couple days of drinking more beer. 

I also got some gout tea from my mom who found it in Chinatown. It seems to work well but isn't cheap. It's sold online as Pure Chinese Herbal Formula, Special Gout Tea.

Has anyone else has luck with either of these?"

I am not a doctor. I work in IT.

I've suffered from horrible gout since I was 23, I'm now 31. I get it in my fingers, toes, wrists, knees, and one elbow.

I take meds (allo and colchicine).

That being said, my Rheumatologist thinks that my kidneys and liver have a hard time clearing uric acid out of my blood rather than I ingest too many purines.

For this reason diet helps minimally .

A couple years back I heard a study in India doing full blood transfusions for people with sever gout and having some success.

So I started donating blood every 2 months(maximum times allowed). This helped quite a bit to manage my UA levels.

After reading that uric acid is carried  in the blood by plasma, I looked up plasma donation.

Plasma donation centers allow you donate 2x a week because they pull the plasma out of your blood, give you back your red blood cells, and then give you saline to replace the plasma.

Plus, they pay me $50 every time I donate, so I make an extra $400 a month.

That's besides the point, I would pay them to take my plasma because it seems to help reduce UA by straight up taking it out of my blood.

My flair ups have been much less frequent with no changes to my diet or medicine regimine.

\*WARNING LONG POST\*

Hey everyone,

I am suffering from my first Gout flare-up. I would like to share what is happening and get some advice, hear feedback etc.

I'm 31 years old, lean muscular body, athletic, healthy mostly plant-based diet, barely drink. Not always been like this though.

I have suffered from psoriasis and IBS (accompanied with Insomnia) since I've been young, but both have been under control for a while. When I was a teenager and early 20s I was very unhealthy. Exessive alcohol, red meat, and lots of processed carbs. I started getting really sick, like really bad IBS. As well as getting ill I would also feel sick/bloated after food. My psoriasis was also horrible, with thick plaques on my head and on parts of my body and legs. I stopped eating meat about 9 years ago and through trial and error noticed that gluten was making me feel sick after eating. After cutting these out, my IBS started getting better and would only have occasional flare-ups. I still drank too much and that had an impact on my psoriasis which remained persistent. Not sleeping would give me trouble and so I would drink to sleep, an unhealthy shitty cycle.

About 6 years ago I cut sugar out my diet pretty much, weaned myself onto dark dark chocolate (which I now love), drank less and started using topical/oral CBD. My psoriasis started clearing up.

Then for the last 4 years, I really switched my life around. I started taking various longevity supplements, eating pretty much keto (pescatarian), started sporting 7 days a week. I went from being overweight/fat (85kg+) to 66kg muscular/lean. I cut alcohol down to a bare minimum. Every few weeks I may have a few cocktails or a few more with the occasional party, and many times months with no drinking.  My psoriasis disappeared and IBS was virtually non-existent (spare from when I stupidly couldn't resist a few bits from my GFs delicious-looking pizza). I would like to add that I have also cooked almost every day for the past few years, healthy delicious fresh food.

About a year ago I started getting joint pain after having a fairly serious combat sports injury in my hip, which resulted in my knees being damaged too.  I went and received stem cell treatment in September. This worked and my injury was pretty much healed but I was very aware that my joints in general were super stuff and clicked (way more than the average person).

Then in October, my house burned down in a horrible accident whilst I was away on holiday. I spent November and December living in a hotel room, before staying at a friend's place for Xmas and new year, before flying to Mexico (where I am currently). During the period in the Hotel, my diet slipped slightly, I was having to eat more processed foods (room service) but nothing crazy unhealthy.

Over the holiday period, I drank way more than I usually would. Xmas eve, day n boxing day. Nye, day and the day after. A lot for me but not a lot compared to most people I know. My diet was less healthy than usual and I had more sugar than my usual (almost zero) but still hardly any in the grand scheme of things. I then flew to Mexico a week ago and had 3 nights where I had alcoholic drinks and a fair amount of seafood.

Then 3 days ago after cycling 20km I went to go get a glass of water and suddenly felt immense pain in my foot. I immediately thought I had broken my foot. My toe/foot was swollen at the side and shiny red. I don't really like visiting hospitals or doctors after being given so much bad advice/medicine previously, so I thought I would wait and see if it was as bad the next day. That night I thought I was dying, which sounds so stupid as it was just a foot! I hobbled to the hospital yesterday and they did an x-ray and blood test. Lo and behold my uric acid level was 8.0 and my inflammatory markers were way high.

They told me I had gout and gave me some prescriptions and a bunch of painkillers. I've lived to deal with chronic pain (without painkillers) for years with my IBS and the injury I mentioned previously however this is a whole new level. Last night I caved and took a lot of painkillers, which only slightly helped.

I am currently sitting here in agony after drinking water with lemon all day (many litres) needing to hobble to the toilet constantly. To all those who have been suffering from this before, wow, fair play. It is horrible.

All the videos/advice online tells me to follow a certain diet (similar to how I eat already) and drink little alcohol (the moderate amount is WAY more than I drink!). I assume that the 2 months of being slightly less healthy have caused this, but it seems pretty crazy that it could cause something that quick and when in comparison to many people it's still been a healthy two months. Going by what I read online, my diet lately just doesn't seem unhealthy compared to what people eat on average, especially those who often suffer from Gout

I wonder if anyone else has Gout who has experienced something similar?

Anybody live a healthy lifestyle and is a similar age but suffer from inflammation-induced Gout?

I read online those with Psoriasis can have higher chances (3 to 5x) more of developing it even if healthy. If so what can you do? I would like to add that I had a TINY patch of Psoriasis appearing after being stressed from the fire, but still a minor flare-up.

I also wondered how effective tart cherry supplements are? I already have been taking MSM and other recommend joint supplements for years.

Does anyone know about the likelihood of it returning and also developing into Psoriatic arthritis (my biggest fear)?

Is it possible to have a one off attack?

Sorry for the ridiculously long message and thanks in advance to anyone who can help. <3

New member, Looking for some advice here.  (Sorry for the long post, half of it is me trying to comfort myself). 

I am 42 yr old healthy male. I used to workout 4 times a week weight lifting and cardio, seriously eating healthy and my weight is in the right bmi. 

Few months ago did a full health test. My hba1c, blood pressure, cholesterol heart everything came normal, but uric acid, blood urea etc came high. Uric acid was close to 7. I was on a keto diet at time and peeing a lot so doc told it could be dehydration. Egfr was 67. So a month later I did another test and egfr was in the 80s. But they didnt do the uric acid. Anyways doc told nothing to worry. 


Fast forward two weeks ago, everyone at home got covid, starting with kids. I also got it but it was pretty mild - with just a dry cough and loss of smell.  10 days post symptoms, on the 11th day I was sleeping in the couch. Woke up after an hour and I had a small pain in my right ankle like a sprain. It pains when I twist my ankle. I thought I sprained my leg whilst in the sleep. Next day there was some swelling around the ankle - walking was a bit painful like I was limping. The day after I had some strong pain - then I took an ibuprofen and the pain became less also the swelling got better as well, but still when I twist the ankle it pains and whilst walking. So I called nhs and my  gp rang back. She told me that some people get joint pain after covid and she also told me could it be gout? Then I told her about the uric acid and she asked me to come in after a week for a full kidney test. I also have foamy urine occasionally, when I dont drink enough water.

Gp told me to keep taking ibuprofen and rest. Yesterday worked in the bed, didnt walk around much. Today 3rd day, I woke up and the pain has subsided significantly, I mean whilst twisting the ankle. All this time I was able to walk but limping and there was no pain when I give weight on the leg. Also I heard alcohol and red meat makes gout worse, so last night I ate some pork sausages and had two 50 ml cognac to see if its flares up, but it didnt. 


Ive been reading a lot about gout and the symptoms are confusing. What makes me even pissed is me eating very healthy and working out regularly maintaining healthy weight - I feel so sad. Everything was for nothing !

Any advice please? I am not overly stressed. If its gout it is, I cant do anything. What I want to know is can I still do weight lifting? I love my squats and deadlifts and kickboxing. Advice please."

I thought it was a physical injury for ages (a sprain from stopping myself falling), but it never went away in months and I eventually realised the pain is exactly like the gout, but its in both my shoulders, not in my toes.

I had a head MRI without contrast done Dec. 4 that showed several nonspecific lesions that may be secondary to demyelination.

Baseline/Persistent Symptoms

* Rocking/unsteady dizziness
* Tingling/numbness in right leg from knee down
* Fatigue like never before

* Tingling in hands and face
* Tingling in BOTH legs from knee down
* Ringing in one or both ears for 10 secs at a time (usually once a day)
* Headaches (5/10) maybe once every 10 days

In October, my uric acid level was 9.1 mg/dL. I started taking these supplements closer to the beginning of November, along with 10,000 IUs of vitamin D & 200 mcgs of K2 per day. I had my levels remeasured this week and my uric acid is now at 8.0 mg/dL. In my opinion, this is a significant improvement from supplements on their own. I would like to hear any thoughts or suggestions. 

Being that Im only 22, I prefer avoiding long-term medications like Allopurinol. I will remeasure my levels in another 3 months and provide an update at that time. 

In addition to supplements, I have completely cut my refined carbohydrate and sugar intake. I believe that the byproducts from sugar/high fructose corn syrup and refined carbohydrates causes more uric acid production than that of animal meat. Sugar and refined carbs also cause dehydration, which in turn, promotes the buildup of uric acid. Over the past 2 years, my poor diet has consisted of an incomprehensible amount of sugar and refined carbs because of fast food consumption, (often multiple times per day). I have insulin resistance, (high insulin promotes more uric acid production), low vitamin D, and a vitamin B deficiency. 

With a very strict diet and the continuation of these supplements, I am hopeful that I can lower my uric acid to normal levels. Additionally, I was instructed by a urologist/kidney surgeon to consume large amounts of alkaline water as a simple solution to my uric acid problem. I will test his theory over the next few months."

After few minutes of sautéing, I added the 2,5 liters of water. I cooked to a broth for nearly 45 minutes.

**Taste test**Not really yummy as expected, so I started improvising and added a few ingredients:

* More pepper, curry powder, salt and 8 bay laurel leaves
* About 5 to 8 grams of cayenne pepper: the spiciness gives a psychological detox feel :)
* 450 grams of broccoli (frozen)

Cayenne pepper has anti-inflammatory properties

Brassica oleracea (broccoli) contains bioactive compounds that act as a XO inhibitor, which suggests that it may lower the synthesis of uric acid in the body (similar to the mechanism of action of allopurinol)  
[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7465980/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7465980/)

Per my last post:
I (23, F) was born 3 months early, no idea what caused it. I've had lung issues and general health issues my entire life. The older I get, the worse my lungs get and no one seems to be able to tell me why. Tired of getting worse for no reason and feeling like no one took me seriously, I did a little research of my own. A friend of mine with CF had symptoms that closely mirrored what I've dealt with for years. So I got a 23+Me kit for fun to see what kinds of things it could tell me about my health but also my ancestry. Note: I don't know or have any relationship with my dad. So this was very helpful. 

UPDATE from last post:
  I did the 23+Me ancestry and health kit for fun and curiosity. Well... I am a Delta F508 deletion carrier. BUT the 23+Me test noted that it only covered about 30 CFTR genes and recommended that I see a genetic counselor to A. Check that the rest of my CFTR genes are okay since I'm a carrier for one, and B. Understand the risk if I choose to have children. 

OPINION: 
I am really shocked that I am even a carrier. I don't know my dad, but NO one on my mom's side even knew what CF was. So I'm not too worried about anything being wrong with the rest of my CFTR genes, but the fact that now I need to find out is a bit upsetting. As much as I want answers for my lifelong symptoms, I am a little nervous to finally get them. Sometimes ignorance is bliss. 
Also, as someone who has wanted kids for as long as I can remember, I am really saddened that now this is something I need to consider. Regardless of if my future child would have CF. It would never change the love and respect I would have for them. After all, what's one more doctor's appointment added to the schedule, ya know? But...
As pro life as I personally am, and as much as I deeply believe that EVERY life has something of value to give to the world... I am also saddened to think that my future children's suffering would be a result of my bogus DNA. Like, how crappy is that? Knowing that I am a carrier and now have a 25% chance of passing on a df508- gene, does it make me selfish that I still deeply want kids? Is it selfish to knowingly risk it? Do any of you wish your parents hadn't risked it? I dont know... just hearing other's thoughts would be nice. Thanks for listening. And thanks for the support, guys. 

FYI, I am going to talk to my primary about it and am definitely going to see a genetic specialist before having kids. But still, the thought is... ugh."

I started doing the Wim Hof cold showers/ ice baths and breathing about 10 months ago after a coworker recommended it. Simply because they felt amazing because of it. In his book he talks about one of the main benefits as massively reducing the amount of inflammation in the body, which is the source of all sorts of chronic disease. He briefly touches on gout but hasnt really looked into it that much.  I figured it couldnt hurt though. 

Im not taking any prescriptions but do have a supply of indomethacin that I dip into if I have a nasty flare up. I historically have 2-3 a year with 1 usually being a monster. Most will last around a week but the big boys can go 3 weeks. 

Since I started the cold showers I havent changed my diet/alcohol at all and havent had a flair up. (If I do get a tingle in my feet, its usually after a weekend of excess, but its cleared after a shower or two.) That was until yesterday, when I got hit with an attack over night that made my foot feel like it was about to split apart.  I realized I had stopped the cold showers for the last few weeks. Probably because of the weather getting much colder and it can be hard to get motivated for a cold shower in the morning. 

That  being said, I did all the normal stuff: extra water, no booze, apple cider vinegar, and ibuprofen. (I also tried nettle tea for the first time which seemed to help) but also took an extra long cold shower and one today. And its like magic. I can walk with very minimal pain and feel like I might have dodged a bullet. 

The best part is that is friggen free! Youre going to be showering anyway just make the last few minutes as cold as it gets! Im not saying that it will work for everyone, but based on my experience Im convinced that its helping me. 

He has a few books out. I listened to his book on tape narrated by Apolo Ohno, the Olympic speed skater. The benefits go way beyond gout; he claims it helps anything from arthritis to cancer. Not that can cure cancer, but MAY help the symptoms and progression. 

I thought Id share the personal insight with other people that I really feel could benefit from it.

I've been lurking on this sub for a while. I have never been diagnosed with gout however after being on this sub for a while and looking up other symptoms I believe I have gout.

However when I went to the doctors 2 days ago they said they're treating me for Plantar Fasciittis as I'm too young for gout (25M)

Did anyone else struggle with this as a diagnosis before gout? 

Now Im not one to act as if I know more or better than a doctor but I had to question whether that was the right diagnosis. 

My symptoms:
1. Pain and when I say pain I mean a lot of it. It's brought tears to my eyes. It's my big toe that is causing the most pain. 
2. Cold and shivery and then hot the next
3. Blue foot with swelling. 
4. Stiff toe and unable to move it
5. Confusion

I had codiene and also Naproxen prescribed to me however these have done nothing in regards to ease or relieve my pain. 

I understand I can't take Reddit as medical advice however I'm just looking for someone with common ground who might be able to offer some form of relief.

Just want to say thank you to everyone who's commented. I've just spent the past 3 hours in the medical department and I've been somewhat diagnosed with Gout. Got a 5 day bout of Colchicine to see if that helps.

","[{""crowd-entity-annotation"":{""entities"":[{""endOffset"":199,""label"":""intervention"",""startOffset"":185},{""endOffset"":241,""label"":""outcome"",""startOffset"":200}]}}]","NEW Study Explains How Epstein-Barr Virus Infection Could Cause/Trigger MS
**Similarities between an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) protein and a brain protein called GlialCAM may explain why EBV infection increases the risk of multiple sclerosis (MS), results from a new study show.**

**Due to the structural resemblance of the two proteins, B-cells  a type of immune cell that is critical to the development of MS  might accidentally end up attacking a persons own healthy tissue while trying to fight off EBV.**

The findings begin to unravel the molecular mechanisms behind the long-known association between EBV infection and MS and may pave the way to the development of novel therapies for the neurodegenerative disease.

Results were published in Nature in the study  which was made available early due to the importance of the research.[Clonally Expanded B Cells in Multiple Sclerosis Bind EBV EBNA1 and GlialCAM,](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04432-7) which was made available early due to the importance of the research.



Epstein-Barr virus infects most people at some point in their lives. Most of the time, EBV infections dont cause noteworthy symptoms, though the virus can cause infectious mononucleosis (colloquially known as mono).

An accumulating body of research has shown a connection between EBV infection and MS. Most recently, a study of more than 10 million U.S. military members showed that infection with EBV increased the risk of developing MS by more than 30 times, placing EBV as the leading cause of MS.

*EBV may be the only risk factor required to develop MS, given essentially 100 percent of people living with MS have been infected with EBV, Lawrence Steinman, MD, a professor at Stanford University and co-author of the study, said in a press release.*

Despite this known connection, it was unclear what series of biochemical events could lead from EBV to MS.

**The new study shows that this connection may lie in immune cells called B-cells, which are best known for producing infection-fighting antibodies. A given antibody is able to bind tightly to a specific molecular target  called an antigen, which may be, for example, a piece of a virus  which triggers the immune system to attack.**

B-cells basically float around the body with antibodies primed on their surface. If their antibody binds to its antigen, the B-cell becomes activated, rapidly dividing and spewing out pro-inflammatory signaling molecules to sound the alarm to the rest of the immune system.

As an activated B-cell divides to produce more cells, the cells undergo a process called somatic hypermutation (SHM). Basically, this involves making small changes to the antibody structure that aim to increase the antibodys ability to stick to its specific antigen.



Here, scientists analyzed B-cells collected from nine patients  five with a first onset of clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) and four with a relapse of relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). From analyses of thousands of B-cells, the researchers showed evidence that many of these cells were behaving as though they were attacking an antigen.

The team then selected 148 unique B-cells from the cerebrospinal fluid (the liquid surrounding the brain and spinal cord) for further analysis, looking at the antigens that these B-cells antibodies were targeting. The team noted that six of the nine patients had B-cells that targeted an EBV protein called EBNA1, and they performed detailed structural analyses of a particular antibody, called mAb MS39p2w174, that bound to a particular region of EBNA1 referred to as AA365-425.

The scientists then noticed that the AA365-425 region of the EBNA1 protein is structurally quite similar to a part of a human protein called GlialCAM. The GlialCAM protein is expressed by certain cells in the brain, including notably oligodendrocytes  the cells chiefly responsible for producing myelin, the fatty sheath around nerve fibers that is the target of the autoimmune attack in MS.

From all these data, the researchers constructed a conceptual model for how EBV might spur the development of MS.

**First, patrolling B-cells would come in contact with the infecting virus, and some B-cells with antibodies that target the EBNA1 protein would become activated. In the course of activating, these cells undergo SHM, which could inadvertently increase the antibodys ability to target GlialCAM.**

**The antibodies then bind to GlialCAM that is expressed by healthy cells in the nervous system, which triggers the immune system to attack  ultimately leading to the development of an autoimmune disease.**

***Until now, we didnt have a step-by-step account of how this drives the immune system to attack a persons own myelin sheath. This new research fills in those gaps and provides clarity into how EBV infection can cause MS, Steinman said.***

The results imply that targeting EBV infections might be a useful strategy for treating MS  and indeed, Steinman noted, this idea is already being explored. For example, Atara Biotherapeutics is sponsoring a Phase 2 clinical trial called EMBOLD (NCT03283826) to test ATA188, an experimental therapy that aims to kill EBV-infected cells in progressive forms of MS.

***These new data further link MS to EBV-infected B cells and plasma cells, highlighting the role of EBV antigens, including EBNA1 protein, in the development of the disease, said AJ Joshi, MD, Ataras chief medical officer.***

*Importantly ATA188, Ataras investigational MS therapy, targets key epitopes of these antigens, including EBNA1, with the hope of ultimately delivering a new treatment option for the millions of people currently living with MS, Joshi added. The actively enrolling Phase 2 EMBOLD study, with a formal interim analysis planned for [the second quarter of] this year, will be a major step toward that direction.*

GERD, LPR, Hiatus hernia cocktail
Hi there! 

Sorry for the long story:

After 4 years of struggle, I was finally diagnosed with hiatus hernia (grade A) and esofagitis. I also have a horrible cough that has been going on for the past 3 years and has been happening increasingly more often, to the point where now it's almost every day. I'm scared of being stuck with any permanent damage to my throat or lungs..

Basically it all started 4 years ago with my heart fluttering/beating hard after every meal. I was prescribed xanax without even having checked my heart.. even though i never had any anxiety problems. For 6 months I took xanax and had the same symptoms, so all the doctors told me to 'just chill, you're stressing too much'. Then a cough started, always at night, lasting between 1-3 hours, i thought it was the smoking so i reduced the cigarettes but it still happened. The doctor did an xray said my lungs are fine and just to stop smoking, but even stopping smoking didn't fix it. It used to happen every few months, then every month, and now every week, almost every single day for the past 10 days. 

The pills don't work, the diet doesn't work, I'm just losing hope in everything, and everything my doctor can say is well, you just have to take omeprazol twice a day for the rest of your life. I'm 31, I don't want to take any pills every day for the rest of my life, especially not one that can damage my kidneys or cause osteoporosis. 

I'm down to a very light decaf coffee a day with a lot of no dairy milk, I'm staying away from sweets such as chocolate, fried and greasy foods. I took omeprazol for the past 3 months, with little to no relief. I quit it for 2 weeks and immediately felt better, only for it to start again right after the endoscopy, so now i'm back on it. 

If you have any tips, any tips at all for living with this or making it more bearable, please do share, because I feel like i'm going up the walls, like I'm only a shell of myself. How do you deal with this?

Thank you and sorry for the long rant."

TL;DR: Epilepsy since 7/21. On trileptal. Also have ADHD. My emotional outbursts/episodes/panic attacks have increased and become severe. Also all ADHD symptoms are multiplied by 100. Exec function, memory, attentiveness... nonexistent. To the point of affecting life. Does my neuro or psych help first?? (I have upcoming appointments with both)


I have pretty severe ADHD (34, F). I have been diagnosed my entire life. I have been able to manage myself VERY well my entire adult life without medication. Even with my career. I do have sensory and mood issues too, but I have been great at managing them and realizing what's triggers them. 

I had my first and only nocturnal TC seizure 7/27/21. With like 10 days prior to that where I woke up insanely sweaty and nauseous and out of it (my neuro said it's likely I had a lot of partial seizures). I am immediately put on Oxcarbazapine (trileptal) because of the number of events I had. I do have recurring partial seizures/auras monthly still.

Here is what's happening to me. 

Since seizure and starting trileptal, my mood and emotional state were the first thing I noticed. I would get overstimulated way easier and it would put me into severe crying episodes, couldn't stop myself, and had to call into work. I would start off irritated, it would turn to almost rage, then into bawling. They happened a couple days, then I felt normal for a while. Now I have noticed that it happens just periodically. If I had to estimate, maybe 3-4 days a month? I also feel exhausted the next day after this. 

Last night, it happened again after a very minor argument with my husband. Irritated first from being overstimulated, then a short rage where I said ""just shut up""to him. This is a big deal because I've NEVER said ""shut up"" to him, ever, in 6 years. Then I snapped out of the anger, got scared that I acted like that, and had a severe panicking cry episode. It made me write this. 

 Memory is SO bad I am even having trouble remembering if I took my trileptal after I have had it in my hand. Or, my pill alarm goes off, I'm busy, I have forgotten within 5 minutes until the second alarm goes off. I have 3 alarms and still take them late sometimes. This is the easiest example, but the memory is SO BAD I can't even think of any more examples at the moment. 

Getting interrupted when I am focused on something is usually a minor inconvenience, but now, it's like I am completely thrown off and am lost. Like a child.  My husband asked me ""I thought you were going to do ___"" And it threw off my imagined ""routine"" so bad that whatever focus I had on cleaning was gone and I was instantly lost, recalculating, bit failing to get back on track. 

Last- overstimulation. Crowds used to be just uncomfortable for me. Now I can't hardly be in them. Lights hurt, sounds are amplified, anxiety skyrockets. Textures bother me more than before. Severely. Basically, all the things that ""bothered"" me before are amplified and make me want to crawl out of my skin. 

Writing this out, I feel so ridiculous, but I am hoping someone out there understands what I'm trying to say and maybe it resonates with them too. This has all been since my seizure. Did epilepsy make my other issues worse or the trileptal?? Who knows."

\*WARNING LONG POST\*

Hey everyone,

I am suffering from my first Gout flare-up. I would like to share what is happening and get some advice, hear feedback etc.

I'm 31 years old, lean muscular body, athletic, healthy mostly plant-based diet, barely drink. Not always been like this though.

I have suffered from psoriasis and IBS (accompanied with Insomnia) since I've been young, but both have been under control for a while. When I was a teenager and early 20s I was very unhealthy. Exessive alcohol, red meat, and lots of processed carbs. I started getting really sick, like really bad IBS. As well as getting ill I would also feel sick/bloated after food. My psoriasis was also horrible, with thick plaques on my head and on parts of my body and legs. I stopped eating meat about 9 years ago and through trial and error noticed that gluten was making me feel sick after eating. After cutting these out, my IBS started getting better and would only have occasional flare-ups. I still drank too much and that had an impact on my psoriasis which remained persistent. Not sleeping would give me trouble and so I would drink to sleep, an unhealthy shitty cycle.

About 6 years ago I cut sugar out my diet pretty much, weaned myself onto dark dark chocolate (which I now love), drank less and started using topical/oral CBD. My psoriasis started clearing up.

Then for the last 4 years, I really switched my life around. I started taking various longevity supplements, eating pretty much keto (pescatarian), started sporting 7 days a week. I went from being overweight/fat (85kg+) to 66kg muscular/lean. I cut alcohol down to a bare minimum. Every few weeks I may have a few cocktails or a few more with the occasional party, and many times months with no drinking.  My psoriasis disappeared and IBS was virtually non-existent (spare from when I stupidly couldn't resist a few bits from my GFs delicious-looking pizza). I would like to add that I have also cooked almost every day for the past few years, healthy delicious fresh food.

About a year ago I started getting joint pain after having a fairly serious combat sports injury in my hip, which resulted in my knees being damaged too.  I went and received stem cell treatment in September. This worked and my injury was pretty much healed but I was very aware that my joints in general were super stuff and clicked (way more than the average person).

Then in October, my house burned down in a horrible accident whilst I was away on holiday. I spent November and December living in a hotel room, before staying at a friend's place for Xmas and new year, before flying to Mexico (where I am currently). During the period in the Hotel, my diet slipped slightly, I was having to eat more processed foods (room service) but nothing crazy unhealthy.

Over the holiday period, I drank way more than I usually would. Xmas eve, day n boxing day. Nye, day and the day after. A lot for me but not a lot compared to most people I know. My diet was less healthy than usual and I had more sugar than my usual (almost zero) but still hardly any in the grand scheme of things. I then flew to Mexico a week ago and had 3 nights where I had alcoholic drinks and a fair amount of seafood.

Then 3 days ago after cycling 20km I went to go get a glass of water and suddenly felt immense pain in my foot. I immediately thought I had broken my foot. My toe/foot was swollen at the side and shiny red. I don't really like visiting hospitals or doctors after being given so much bad advice/medicine previously, so I thought I would wait and see if it was as bad the next day. That night I thought I was dying, which sounds so stupid as it was just a foot! I hobbled to the hospital yesterday and they did an x-ray and blood test. Lo and behold my uric acid level was 8.0 and my inflammatory markers were way high.

They told me I had gout and gave me some prescriptions and a bunch of painkillers. I've lived to deal with chronic pain (without painkillers) for years with my IBS and the injury I mentioned previously however this is a whole new level. Last night I caved and took a lot of painkillers, which only slightly helped.

I am currently sitting here in agony after drinking water with lemon all day (many litres) needing to hobble to the toilet constantly. To all those who have been suffering from this before, wow, fair play. It is horrible.

All the videos/advice online tells me to follow a certain diet (similar to how I eat already) and drink little alcohol (the moderate amount is WAY more than I drink!). I assume that the 2 months of being slightly less healthy have caused this, but it seems pretty crazy that it could cause something that quick and when in comparison to many people it's still been a healthy two months. Going by what I read online, my diet lately just doesn't seem unhealthy compared to what people eat on average, especially those who often suffer from Gout

I wonder if anyone else has Gout who has experienced something similar?

Anybody live a healthy lifestyle and is a similar age but suffer from inflammation-induced Gout?

I read online those with Psoriasis can have higher chances (3 to 5x) more of developing it even if healthy. If so what can you do? I would like to add that I had a TINY patch of Psoriasis appearing after being stressed from the fire, but still a minor flare-up.

I also wondered how effective tart cherry supplements are? I already have been taking MSM and other recommend joint supplements for years.

Does anyone know about the likelihood of it returning and also developing into Psoriatic arthritis (my biggest fear)?

Is it possible to have a one off attack?

Sorry for the ridiculously long message and thanks in advance to anyone who can help. <3

Hi all. Semi frequent lurker. First time poster.

Im on about day 6 of a flare up in my big toe. This is year three of me having a flare up around the same time of year (sometime in the winter). Ive never been prescribed anything besides NSAIDs but have been taking a tapering dose of prednisone that my mother in law had in reserve (former nurse). 

This flare up is particularly frustrating because in the last year, Ive made major positive changes in my lifestyle. I went on noom, lost about 65 pounds (63, current weight 237). I have been drinking minimum 80 ounces of water a day for the last year) and intensely exercise usually 5 of 7 days a week. I also have been taking a single tart cherry extract supplement every day for over a year. I drink infrequently, maybe one night on the weekend, and not that much to boot.

Ive never felt physically better until this shit hits me like a brick.

Part of the reason I decided to make these changes was because of my first gout attack 3 years ago. Absolutely miserable experience. My dad has a history of it but I thought Id at least get a few years more before it effected me (currently 31 years old). Hes been on Allo but has never decided to lose his own weight. 

I have another doctors appointment on Friday where theyre planning to test UA levels and do a kidney analysis. 

My question is, because this seems to be a yearly thing and not as frequent an occurrence as some others in this sub have unfortunately experienced, should I bite the bullet and just demand allo? Or should I just keep a stash of prednisone on me for flare ups (even though it hasnt done much for me for this attack)?

This last attack has seemed to last longer than the others but hasnt been as acutely painful. But its gotten me a little depressed as I havent been able to move and my weight loss journey has come to a grinding halt. Any information or shared experiences would be greatly appreciated."

Hello!  Im a guy with MS who has previously had low testosterone numbers pre-dx (eg below 12 nmol/L).  Ive been feeling especially crappy lately (low energy stuff).  So rather than just accept its MS, I dove into the rabbit hole of trying to find why I feel crappy and came across something interesting that may affect others in here.

Since my dx, Ive been taking supplements to help control my MS.  And my regime and DMT have worked.  My MS went from highly active at dx to NEDA now.  One thing I do every day is I take a flax seed oil + curcumin capsule.

Flax seed oil reduces relapses by 60% according to this study by Dr Jelinik (of OMS diet):

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3821380/

Awesome.  I am only taking 1x1000mg capsule daily- not a lot.  However, apparently when taking with curcumin + piperine, absorption is increased.  

Now, back to me feeling crappy.  I went to an endocrinologist, described symptoms I was having, and she sent me for a blood panel.  It came back with a ridiculously high testosterone number.  Like almost 30 nmol/L - an unnatural number for my age and totally inconsistent with my prior panel.  I should be rocking a massive erection constantly.  But instead, its barely even just okay.  Likewise with body hair, I dont have very much.  And Im hardly very muscular either.  Somethings not right with that number.

So I started reading and found an association between flax seed oil and testosterone that fit:

The reason that flaxseeds are on the hit list for raising testosterone is because they are rich in lignans, which tend to mimic estrogen in the body. Since estrogen is the opposing sex hormone to testosterone, the more of it you have (particularly if you are a man), the more low testosterone-like symptoms youll have. (from: https://www.shawacademy.com/blog/6-foods-to-avoid-to-optimise-natural-testosterone/ )

Also its discussed at length in setting of PCOS at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2752973/

Whats interesting is, testosterone is associated with a neuroprotective effect in MS.  (from: https://www.mdedge.com/multiplesclerosishub/article/134428/multiple-sclerosis/testosterone-affects-outcomes-men-ms ).

The effect of estrogen-mimicking lignans fits as a culprit for feeling crappy in a hypogonadism sense - but it also seems to fit the unexplained data from Dr Jeliniks study showing how much more effective flax seed oil was compared to other Omega-3s, since lignans are a unique element not found in fish oils.

If only that Omega-3 study had an endocrine panel, this theory might be solved.  It seems like tapering down flax seed oil intake would help me feel better- but could also reduce beneficial effect of the high testosterone on my MS.

Not sure which path to take.  But an interesting set of associations!  If any smart person has any guidance or this is all wrong, would be helpful!"

I have a friend who struggles with gout. He has for many years and has tried many treatments. Im sure that a lot of his problem was brought on by unhealthy lifestyle. 

He found a medicine from Mexico that helps him with the pain immediately and has been using it for a few years now. He basically needs this to function, otherwise the gout will be so bad he is bedridden in extreme pain. 

He went to the doctor recently and the they are trying to wean him off of this unknown medication. A lab to get it identified costs about $30k so thats not money he wants to spend. His doctor thinks its a steroid but no one really knows.

The part that is a real mystery for me is that he has had a very strict diet for the past three months and hasnt really lost any weight. No alcohol, no carbs or sugars except some fruit. My suspicion is this mystery medicine is preventing the weight loss. He does have diabetes but his sugar is under control just from the diet so he isnt taking diabetes meds, my first thought was the diabetes meds could be the cause of the weight not being shed but since hes not taking the diabetes meds it might be the unknown medicine from Mexico thats preventing the weight loss.


He does also take meds for high blood pressure. He also suffers kidney stones and pain, I am thinking as a side effect of the other medicine. Also his liver is in bad shape but it did improve recently evidenced by his lab tests. He has fatty liver. 


Does anyone know what kind of medicine it could be? Its unmarked pills. Has anyone here ever used a medicine that gives relief as fast as this? If anyone here is thinking to take it please dont. It doesnt solve the problem. It just kicks the can down the road.

Im not sure how to fix the issue. If he stops cold turkey he will be out for a few weeks at least in extreme pain.

Hi guys,

&#x200B;

I just wanted to reach out to get some opinions on my current situation and what not.

&#x200B;

I've experienced acid reflux for quite a number of years now, on and off, kind of severe at stages, this is over probably about 5-6 years now. I would say the past few years it's even worse.

Lately over the past couple of months, probably 4-5 months, it's been worse, I have been losing weight despite eating, probably some periods in there I probably haven't eaten enough, but my appetite has remained fairly consistent. I have lost about 6 kg in around 4 months now.

I have been in a very stressful situation the past 4-5 months as well, my father had a stroke and then it was found that he had lung cancer, this put a lot of stress/burden on myself as I had to help take care of him and work as well, however I don't want to put this all down to just stress just in case it's not the cause of what's been happening.

I'm having stomach issues fairly consistently, acid reflux, heartburn, indigestion, feelings of hunger.

Symptoms seem to all point to stomach cancer, though I know looking things up doesn't help.

I've been to a doctor, doctor didn't think it was cancer because of my age, I am 33. I have an urgent referral to a specialist however to get checked up, unfortunately it's already been 3 weeks and I haven't heard anything yet.

I don't appear to be gaining weight back, over the past 4 weeks I don't really appear to be losing much more weight and if so, barely any. But I am finding after waking up, I seem to have lost a lot of weight, then kind of put it back on but I think that's mostly water weight.

I kinda feel like it's cancer speeding up my metabolism.

Sometimes I feel like not eating much but that's not not very often at all, but that's due to the stomach issues, but for the most part I am still eating, not getting any food stuck in my throat or any of that.

I don't take NSAIDs as I read that can cause stomach issues, I don't believe I have a H pylori infection, though that hasn't been confirmed yet. So I think the chances of having a stomach ulcer are probably quite slim.

I am not vomiting blood or passing any blood in my stools as well.

&#x200B;

\*\*UPDATE\*\* After 5 weeks from being referred I received a letter to do blood tests. (checked over the tests, fairly sure my GP could have done all these and sent them to the specialist, would have been ideal..)

&#x200B;

\*\*UPDATE\*\* Had a virtual meeting with a specialist, wasn't a GI specialist sadly, was referred to a specialist of general medicine apparently. Wasn't very helpful, was asked to do blood tests, if nothing comes back on blood tests, was advised I will need scans done. Asked about endoscopy, doesn't appear that they want to perform an endoscopy on me. It's taken 6 weeks just to get to the beginning of it all.

**UPDATE** Did some blood tests, confirmed no kidney issues, diabetes or thyroid issues, got a few more blood tests to do then apparently I have to do scans, I mentioned I wanted an endoscopy but was ignored and denied, they don't seem to think I have stomach cancer...

**UPDATE** Some new symptoms have cropped up, stools have been much lighter than normal for 2-3 months now, some cases of diarrhea and constipation as well as sometimes thin stools."

*Summary: A study of monozygotic twins allowed researchers to discover which parts of immune dysfunction in multiple sclerosis were influenced by genetics, and which were influenced by environmental factors.*

Researchers at the University of Zurich and Munichs LMU Klinikum hospital have studied the immune system of pairs of monozygotic twins to identify the influence of the environment and of genetics in cases of multiple sclerosis. In the process, they may have discovered precursor cells of the disease-causing T cells.

**Genetic predisposition alone does not lead to MS**

Studies in recent years have clearly shown that genetic risk variants are a necessary condition for developing multiple sclerosis. Based on our study, we were able to show that about half of the composition of our immune system is determined by genetics, says Florian Ingelfinger, a Ph.D. candidate at the UZH Institute of Experimental Immunology.

In the study, the researchers recruited 61 pairs of monozygotic twins where one twin is affected by MS and the co-twin is healthy. From a genetic point of view, the twins were thus identical. Although the healthy twins also had the maximum genetic risk for MS, they showed no clinical signs of the disease, says Lisa Ann Gerdes.

**Thanks to this globally unique cohort of identical twins, the researchers were able to exclude genetic influences by comparing twins with and without multiple sclerosis.**

*We are exploring the central question of how the immune system of two genetically identical individuals leads to significant inflammation and massive nerve damage in one case, and no damage at all in the other,* explains Burkhard Becher. **Using identical twins enabled the international team of scientists to rule out the genetic influence and specifically track the immune system changes that were ultimately responsible for triggering MS in one twin.**

*Surprisingly, we found the biggest differences in the immune profiles of MS affected twins in to be in the cytokine receptors, i.e., the way immune cells communicate with one another. The cytokine network is like the language of the immune system,* says Ingelfinger.

**The researchers found that increased sensitivity to certain cytokines leads to greater activation of T cells in the blood of patients with multiple sclerosis. These T cells are more likely to migrate into the central nervous system of patients and cause damage there. The identified cells were found to have the characteristics of recently activated cells, which were in the process of developing into fully functional T cells. *We may have discovered the cellular big bang of MS hereprecursor cells that give rise to disease-causing T cells,* says Becher.**

*The findings of this study are particularly valuable in comparison to previous studies of MS which do not control for genetic predisposition, says Burkhard Becher. We are thus able to find out which part of the immune dysfunction in MS is influenced by genetic components and which by environmental factors. This is of fundamental importance in understanding the development of the disease.*

I'm a 50+ male who was diagnosed with gout in 2018 (but probably had it for years prior).  I'm not a fan of taking drugs as the side effects can be significant and efficacy questionable. I read r/gout for a couple of years and went through at least 9 bouts of pain, 2-3 of them ""9+"". I became convinced that allo was safe and had few side effects, so started taking 1 year ago. I bought a UASure and tested by UA levels bi-weekly (usually) and recording my perceived pain levels. I'm 6'+ and 200+ so I decided to increase from 300mg to 500mg pretty early and have stayed there, although I'm considering dropping back down to 300mg (mostly because one pill is easier than 3 (300+100+100)).

I thought I would just have to live with foot pain for the rest of my life but now its a rare (and getting rarer) event.

Hi everyone!

This has been a rough go but Ill try to explain. I never had heartburn in my life until getting pregnant in 2019. Pepcid worked for me when I was pregnant but it stopped working a couple months postpartum. 
I started taking omeprazole 20 Dec 2019 and it worked like a charm. I had no issues until February 2021 when I started getting digestive issues of stomach aches and gas. Tested positive for h pylori and Sibo which I treated with antimicrocials successfully. The naturopath doctor suggested I wean off ppis and I had been successfully taken 10mgs without symptoms for 6 weeks. I came off ppis and didnt have symptoms for 12 days and got intense burning back pain and throat pain in august.

So I got back on 20mg and this is where the yo-yo began. I tried tapering off 2 more times and failed each time needing a higher dose to manage my symptoms.

December 5th I accidently ate guacamole that had jalapeños in it and have been suffering ever since(mind you I was on nexium 40mg at the time):

Throat burning 
Clogged ears 
Voice hoarseness

Currently Ive been on 80mg of nexium since December 9th, had an endoscopy on 12/22 which was clear and negative for biopsies. I do have a 2cm sliding hiatal hernia.

Things Im trying:
Ppis
A wedge pillow
Gaviscon advance 
Pepcid before bed
Stop eating 3 hours before bed
Currently in healing phase acid watchers diet
Alkaline water

I was wondering if anyone has any suggestions or had someone had it take several weeks to recover after a bad flare even with ppis? Im a bit better but still really a struggle

some patients never experience another attack, particularly those with just mild serum urate elevations.

","[{""crowd-entity-annotation"":{""entities"":[{""endOffset"":223,""label"":""population"",""startOffset"":205}]}}]","RESEARCH: Longitudinal, 20-year Study, Shows EBV May Trigger MS
For decades, researchers have suspected that people infected with an exceedingly common virus, Epstein-Barr, might be more likely to develop multiple sclerosis, a neurological illness that affects a million people in the United States. Now, a team of researchers reports what some say is the most compelling evidence yet of a strong link between the two diseases.

The virus infects nearly everyone in their teen or young adult years, and very few go on to develop multiple sclerosis. **The researchers also note that it is not the only known risk factor for people who develop the illness. But they say their data points to it being the clearest of them all.** While it remains to be seen whether the finding will result in treatments or cures for multiple sclerosis, the study may further motivate research into therapies and vaccines for the condition.

In their [*study*](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abj8222), published Thursday in Science, the group examined data from 10 million people on active duty in the United States Armed Forces over two decades. The strength of their study, said its principal investigator, Dr. Alberto Ascherio, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, is that they were able to follow people for years and ask whether infections with Epstein-Barr preceded multiple sclerosis.

Among the service members in the study, 801 developed multiple sclerosis.

At the same time, the virus in question, Epstein-Barr, is common, infecting nearly everyone in the population at some point. Although few are aware that they were infected, some develop mononucleosis. The virus remains in the body for life.

**Because so few who are infected with the virus get multiple sclerosis, it cannot be the sole cause of the disease. Other risk factors have been identified, including some, like low levels of vitamin D and smoking, that were seen previously by the Harvard group using the same data set. There also are genetic factors  900 abnormal genes have been identified in patients with multiple sclerosis, said Dr. Anthony J. Reder, a multiple sclerosis expert at the University of Chicago, who was not involved in the new study. Gender also plays a role; most patients are women.**

But, Dr. Ascherio said, *no risk factor stands out like Epstein-Barr infections.*

**To ask how much the virus increases risk, the investigators studied the small proportion of people who were not infected with the virus early in their service careers but subsequently became infected. They detected infections by the presence of antibodies to the virus.**

**Among the multiple sclerosis patients, 32 out of 33 got infected with Epstein-Barr before they developed M.S.**

As a control group for their study, the scientists tracked 90 individuals who were not initially infected with Epstein-Barr and who also did not get multiple sclerosis. **Of them, just 51 subsequently became infected with Epstein-Barr. That meant an Epstein-Barr virus infection increased the risk of multiple sclerosis over thirtyfold, Dr. Ascherio said.**

But Dr. Reder cautioned that it could be hard to tease out cause and effect from an epidemiological study. People who develop multiple sclerosis have overactive immune systems that make them develop high levels of antibodies to viral infections. Multiple sclerosis might arise not because of the virus but because of the bodys response to it.

*Multiple sclerosis patients have fewer viral infections than normal, he said, because their immune systems are so active that they effectively fight off viruses. Multiple sclerosis patients often say, I never get a cold. When I hear that, my ears perk up.*

So far, he added, anti-viral drugs have not helped patients with multiple sclerosis.

The Harvard group tried to control for the possibility that the immune systems response, not the virus itself, increases the risk of multiple sclerosis in those infected with Epstein-Barr. They asked if antibodies to another common virus, cytomegalovirus, also were linked to a greater risk of multiple sclerosis. They were not.

But cytomegalovirus, Dr. Reder said, for unknown reasons, seems to protect against multiple sclerosis. So the fact that those infected with it did not have a higher risk of multiple sclerosis might not be surprising.

Others said the study was convincing evidence of cause and effect.

*The way it was done is quite compelling, said Dr. Michael Davin Kornberg, a multiple sclerosis specialist at Johns Hopkins. It really is the most convincing data weve had for a causal association.*

Dr. Bruce Cree, a multiple sclerosis researcher at the University of California, San Francisco, noted that it might be difficult to treat multiple sclerosis by going after Epstein-Barr because it can be difficult to find the actual virus in patients. Even though multiple sclerosis is a disease of the brain and spinal cord, he could not find the virus in patients spinal fluid.

But patients do seem to harbor cells in their brains that produce antibodies to Epstein-Barr virus. Dr. Cree is researching whether he can treat multiple sclerosis patients by eradicating those cells, which are infected with Epstein-Barr.

And Dr. Lawrence Steinman, a multiple sclerosis researcher at Stanford, who wrote a perspective accompanying the Harvard groups paper, said an experimental mRNA vaccine against Epstein-Barr was one of a number of approaches being designed to stop the virus from affecting the brain.

The question now, he said, is, ***Can we make multiple sclerosis go away?***

Maybe get 2-3 flares a year...but more if I put a lot of pressure on my feet from over-use or get dehydrated etc.

The flare seems to have been caused by a new ARB and FloMax prescription for some blood pressure and prostate concerns....but I digress...still working on that possibility.

Anyways...the indo alone was not working, so added the colchicine....a bit better, but still getting up/downs (and a wonky stomach too) and last night was horrible.  Went to the local clinic for more advice as can't get to my regular doc on short notice, and he suggested prednisone.  We discussed (after seeing many posts here) also going on Allopurinal for a longer term solution once I get this bout fixed and I'll look at that down the road.

Problem is, I am not sure if I should be continuing the indo AND the colchicine AND prednisone I got today all at the same time?  Seems to be an either/or, not both...but I forgot or did not get clear advice.  Just a few hours after taking the prednisone, I could literally feel the gout ""melt"" away and pain is almost completely gone already....wow.

So, I was diagnosed with CFLD around 2007, but we (me and my mom) actually didn't know this wasn't a normal part of CF that every CF'er has.(Because apparently, only 8% have it...?)

We found out that it isn't that normal just a couple of weeks ago. So, for those of you who also have CFLD, I was wondering what's it like for you? Does it make you feel sicker? Have you had hospitalisations for CFLD complications alone? Have some of you maybe even had a liver transplant? What does treatment look like for you?

Also, on my latest abdominal echo scan thingy, they noticed my spleen was slightly enlarged,, 13 cm. This isn't drastic, but it still leaves me with questions. What does this mean? How fast can it deteriorate? What treatment is there? What further complications could this cause?

Anything you can tell me would be useful since I don't know that much about it. And yes, I did Google some stuff but I'd rather hear it from someone's own experience. So feel free to explain and tell me anything you want below! Thanks for reading!"

I wanted to share my story in hopes it could possibly help someone or there are other people going through what I'm experiencing.   
Like many others here my story began several years ago with constant nagging, gnawing heartburn for which I was prescribed Omeprazole. This seemed to remedy my symptoms, and even though I've always had a fear/aversion to being on a long-term medication before I knew it, it had been 3 years or so. Until one day the original symptoms came back, and this time way worse. I began experiencing that feeling of a fist trying to punch its way up and out of my chest. I even questioned if I had heart issues. It was pretty awful, so after several rounds of tests, including an Endoscopy, I was told I had a hiatal hernia. The GI Dr. switched me from 20 mg of Omeprazole to 40 mg and Pantoprazole and that calmed down the pain. Again, even though I was still wary of an even higher dose of daily medication, being relieved of the pain outweighed these fears and before I knew it, another 3 or so years had gone by being a slave to this drug.   
Then about a year ago I began having horrible pain in my pelvic region. I won't go into all the details, but nothing about it made me think it was a GI issue, more of a urologic issue. So after rounds of antibiotics for what they thought was prostatitis, CT scans, and even cystoscopy (if you don't know that that is look it up. Basically medieval torture!) - all of it inconclusive. I was so desperate I even tried acupuncture which did nothing. I was beginning to believe I had CPPS (chronic pelvic pain syndrome), when as a last-ditch desperate move I decided to try eliminating gluten from my diet. To my astonishment, within a little over a week, all of my symptoms magically vanished!  
I'm about 8 months into my gluten-free diet and feel great, but I began questioning what could have caused this. Why at the age of 41 did my body suddenly decide to reject gluten? I did a celiac test and it was negative and have no family history of gluten intolerance. After doing some research I came across a study that found a link between [PPI use and gluten intolerance](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3947159/) and my jaw hit the floor.  
I now believe this long-term use of PPIs has caused this and am currently in the process of trying to wean off the Pantoprazole by cutting it in half and taking it only every other day. The GERD symptoms have returned however so I've scheduled another appt with the GI Dr to discuss a way forward without PPIs. I'm holding out a small bit of hope that if I'm able to completely go off the PPPs the gluten intolerance could possibly reverse, but I know that's not likely.   
Does anyone have any alternative approaches besides the obvious diet restrictions to keep GURD at bay without this evil medication?"

[Nonpharmacological Management of Gout and Hyperuricemia: Hints for Better Lifestyle](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6125106/)

Folks it's articles like this that I think cause a lot of confusion on gout.  People come here looking for ways to avoid being on life long medication or how to mitigate pain or how to stop a flare.  This article points to a lot of the things people try to control gout flares that aren't drugs.  Please understand control of uric acid levels - when talking about gout means keeping your UA levels lower than 6mg/dL (5 if you have tophi) and keeping it there.  Everything else is trying to stop gout flaring - your immune system response to monosodium urate crystals.

[Why does the gout attack stop? A roadmap for the immune pathogenesis of gout](https://rmdopen.bmj.com/content/1/Suppl_1/e000046)

In reality you have probably been hyperuricemic for quite some time (years) as uric acid isn't usually tested unless there is an issue.  Monosodium urate crystals have been building up in your joints.  Then one day you stub your toe or eat that trigger food that causes inflammation - and you have a gout flare.  You take anti-inflammatories(NASID) and/or immunosuppressants(colchicine) to stop your immune system response.  At some point the immune system may stop and the crystals get sheathed - until you stub your toe again or eat that foot that causes inflammation.  Rinse/Repeat.  The gout flares ebb and flow with your immune system response - not with crystals coming and going.  When you go onto a Urate lowering therapy it could be months to years before all the crystals dissolve - even though your uric acid is held low.  6 months after I had my UA levels at 5.5mg/dL - I still flared which means that there were still MSU crystals present.  Controlling serum uric acid levels needs to be a constant low - with a threat of flaring anyway as the crystals dissolve and the sheaths get disturbed.  Eating your way to a low enough serum acid level is difficult in my experience.  

FTA (Nonpharmacological Management) - emphasis is mine

>Since uric acid is an end-product of purine metabolism in humans, it is reasonable to suggest that excessive ingestion of purine-rich foods causes an increase in serum uric acid. In fact, ingestion of RNA (corresponding to 225 mg purine/kg of body weight) increased plasma uric acid by **0.74 mg/dL,** indicating that excessive consumption of purine increases plasma uric acid concentration.[23](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6125106/#bibr23-1559827615601973) However, not all purine-containing foods have the same effect on serum uric acid level and gout risk.

&#x200B;

>**A purine-rich diet for 1 to 2 weeks produces only a small transient rise in serum uric acid level of 1 to 2 mg/dL, while an isocaloric low-purine diet for 7 to 10 days will slightly reduce serum uric acid by about 1 to 2 mg/dL**.[30](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6125106/#bibr30-1559827615601973),[31](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6125106/#bibr31-1559827615601973) **suggesting that strict restriction of consumption of purine is not practical or effective for uric acid control.** Accordingly, adequate calorie intake and weight management with moderation of meat and seafood in the diet has been recently recommended for gout/hyperuricemia subjects.

This has been my experience.  On the extreme end - on a keto/low carb high fat diet (LCHF) - I have lost a lot of weight \~50lbs down now - and have dropped my serum acid levels from 5.5mg/dL to 4.5mg/dL.  In addition I eat a lot of high purine foods - red meat, anchovies, shellfish.  I am just one person but I am adding my anecdotal evidence that it isn't purine ingestion that causes serum acid levels to rise.  My best guess is the reduction of sugar is the reason for my decrease in serum acid levels - from some of the other articles I have read.

[Fructose Intake, Serum Uric Acid, and Cardiometabolic Disorders: A Critical Review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5409734/)

TL;DR - My take - Gouty Arthritis is curable - by lowering your UA levels low enough for MSU crystals to dissolve.  Hyperuricemia is manageable through daily ULT medication.  Eating and supplementation typically only addresses flaring (Gouty Arthritis) - not Hyperuricimea (UA levels > 6.8mg/dL)

TL;DR2 - Do everything you can to lose weight, be healthy, eat right, stay hydrated - these are all good things - but do not be discouraged if you can't control your gout with these things.  There are safe and effective drugs that have been FDA tested and approved."

I had my first gout flare-up when I was around 40. The previous night I had gone out for a burger and beer and the next day, I swore I must have somehow broken my toe...the pain was...you know. 

Fast forward to today. It took me around 8 years to finally get on Allipuranol and while the flare-ups decreased in frequency it took me increasing my dosage to 300mg before they really subsided. 

I've learned a lot about my triggers and have read far too much than I ever thought I would about a disease. In short while I haven't had a beer in probably 10 years, I still occasionally have a glass of wine...and now maybe a scotch or whisky.

I decided to really change my life too as I'm 50+ now and I still have a child in elementary school. Over the past 2 years, I was diagnosed with a fatty liver and that was the last straw. Since that time I've eliminated saturated fats, cholesterol, and I've tried to decrease all added sugars.

I've dropped 50 lbs and gone from 220 lbs to 170lbs. I've also gone to a 95% plant-based diet. I occasionally have salmon but otherwise, I only eat plant-based foods. 

My high blood pressure, snoring, elevated A1C (liver enzymes), high heart rate, and tophi precursors on my feet, ...all of it, are gone. My uric acid fluctuates between 3.9 and 6.4 (after halving my Allipuranol dosage down to 150 mg). Fearful of having my gout recure, I've decided to stay on the Allipuranol for now but I'm still hopeful that I can indeed get off of it someday.

All that said, I'm running again, I'm backpacking, and greatly enjoying life again.

I'm curious to know if anybody has beaten their gout demons and been able to get off the meds...and if so how? Have you made any similar changes and how has it affected your gout?

I'm hopeful but still not sure where this journey leads."

Effects are proven in vitro or in vivo and not always in humans. I just wanted to do this as a little experiment for fun.

Base ingredients:

* 600 grams of celery root
* 400 grams of celery
* 10 grams of turmeric
* 10 grams of curry powder
* 5 grams of black pepper
* One ginger root
* Two cloves of garlic
* 2,5 liters of water
* 30 mL of sunflower oil for sautéing

Celery is proven to lower uric acid levels  
[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6047868/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6047868/)

Turmeric contains curcumin, which has several health benefits, including lowering uric acid  
[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24445038/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24445038/)

Piperine in black pepper increases serum concentrations of curcumin  
[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9619120/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9619120/)

Ginger, garlic (and curry (= mixture of herbs such as turmeric)) have anti-inflammatory effects which would relieve pain during an attack  
[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5115784/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5115784/)[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6678835/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6678835/)

\*\*Method (Part I)\*\*I heated the oil in a large pot, added garlic, ginger and spices to the mix and sautéd for a short period. I then added cubes of celery root, pieces of celery to the pot. After few minutes of sautéing, I added the 2,5 liters of water. I cooked to a broth for nearly 45 minutes.

**Taste test**Not really yummy as expected, so I started improvising and added a few ingredients:

* More pepper, curry powder, salt and 8 bay laurel leaves
* About 5 to 8 grams of cayenne pepper: the spiciness gives a psychological detox feel :)
* 450 grams of broccoli (frozen)

Cayenne pepper has anti-inflammatory properties  
[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7432674/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7432674/)

Brassica oleracea (broccoli) contains bioactive compounds that act as a XO inhibitor, which suggests that it may lower the synthesis of uric acid in the body (similar to the mechanism of action of allopurinol)  
[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7465980/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7465980/)

\*\*Method (Part II)\*\*Added extra ingredients to the large pot and cooked for another 15 minutes. After almost forgetting to remove the laurel leaves, I mixed everything until a smooth green liquid.



And there you have it!

Filled 6 containers with portions of 350 mL each and one cup to reward myself for the making of it! Taste test: Good enough for me and spicy AF!

Can anyone relate?
Hi,
I have recently joined reddit for another issue unrelated to what I will post about here. My boyfriend and his mom for the past five years have been caregivinging for my boyfriend's 29 y.o. brother. 

My boyfriend's brother has an unusual form of epilepsy. He has multiple seizures a day, and has had them every day starting 5 years ago. He has, as I understand it, hypermotor seizures, and does not have the tonic clonic seizures. So when he has individual seizures, he doesn't need to go the the ER, but the seizures involve a lot of arm and leg movement, and he can injure himself, or potentially injure others, quite seriously. 

My boyfriend's brother has had epilepsy since he was a baby. His epilepsy has always been intractable, but before the increase in his seizures five years ago he would generally have nighttime seizures that didn't impact his daily life. I don't know a lot about his medication, but I know he is on quite high amounts of anti-seizure medication. I know that the college of pharmacists in our area issues him a letter every so often, because he is on a very high doses of anti-seizure medication. As I think people know here in this subreddit, the anti-seizure medication has lots of side effects that affect daily life. My boyfriend's brother is also trying professionally prescribed CBD treatments, but he finds this frustrating because the cbd is not covered by our government Healthcare plans and he pays a high amount for CBD oil and doesn't feel like it's making much of a difference. 

He also had a neuro surgery to help, but after a few months the seizures became just as frequent as they were before the surgery. I believe it was confirmed my boyfriend's brother has ""focal cortical displasia."" My understanding is that neurologists were able to confirm this after examining brain tissue after the surgery.

His form of epilepsy has affected his daily life quite a bit. My boyfriend's whole family would like him to live at home. Another problem is the uncertainty of the situation.  My boyfriend's brother and the whole family hopes the situation will improve, but there is no knowledge about what can be expected. I think the other option is to put their 29 year old family member in long term care, which the family is very uncertain about and saddened about putting a loved one, as a young man, into a long term care facility. They do not want to pursue this option. I don't know if anyone here has had this challenge: whether to put a loved one (or personally deciding) about going into a long term care facility, or trying to live at home.

Is there anyone else here who has experience, personally or another loved one, with intractable epilepsy, focal cortical displasia, or with hypermotor seizures? 

I think it is a more rare form of epilepsy, and I don't believe a lot of people in the city where we live has very many people, if there is anyone at all, who have the same condition as my boyfriend's brother. I would like to learn more. 

I don't live with my boyfriend's brother. At the moment the mom, and the two brothers are all living together to support one another. As I date my boyfriend over time, I am here with the family during weekends, over holidays and such. Although my boyfriend's brother is an adult, and I don't live with the family, i am not really involved in his care, I'm just more of a witness to what's going on with the family, and am interested to learn more. 

Does anyone have experience with this?"

Ive only been on Ocrevus for about 6 months. I had my first infusion in September.

So today I got some routine blood work done. The lab reports came back showing I had very high WBC, high neutrophils absolute, and low lymphocytes. (Google says that it usually indicates the body is fighting an infection or the big C.)

I had just gotten my wisdom tooth removed yesterday and prior to that I was on antibiotics for about 2 weeks. I was having severe pain and discomfort prior to the tooth being removed(massive cavity/decay on that wisdom boy).

My concern comes from seeing those abnormal results, primarily in those fields(everything else was normal and in the green). Has anyone encountered abnormal blood results after being on Ocrevus? Or even after being on antibiotics while on Ocrevus?

I know theres always an increased risk of cancer when dealing certain medications, and that a high WBC is an indicator of such. I have reached out to my doctor with these concerns, but have yet to hear back, so I wanted to chime in here to see what yalls thoughts and experiences have been. And if there have been similar situations with anyone.

Hello all, 21f rrms

Sometimes I really get to thinking about the origin of my MS. I read an article here a few months back about having family with different autoimmune diseases and then getting ms and wow does that really connect the dots for me. My dad and brother both have/ had psoriasis, I even had a small patch of psoriasis on my knee as a child that eventually went away. 
I also get to thinking about the connection between low vitamin D and ms and it just makes so much sense! I was allergic to the sun as a childI would get hives/ blistering, fatigue, shortness of breath out in the sun (especially in summer) so I had to spend my time outside in increments. In late adolescence my allergy to the sun became less severe but still have all the same symptoms as I did when I was a kid. Imagine my surprise when I went for blood work and my vitamin d was 13.9 (the lowest threshold of normal is 31). I take daily otc vitamin d and was on 50,000 IU vit d for a month or 2 a few months back. Im back on the 50,000 IU again but Im thinking that my body doesnt absorb it well and the sun and I just dont get along lol. I mean there is no way to know for sure  but those are my theories. Do any of you ever try to connect the dots of the origin of your ms??"

Hello all!

Background info:
- I'm 25F RRMS Brit, living in Europe. Diagnosed last July 2021 after what I suspect was around a year of emerging symptoms. MRI found 20+ lesions in the brain and 3 in the spine. The docs aren't sure if I was a long time untreated or just have rather aggressive attacks. Therapy settled all my complaints and I've been living (so I think) symptomless since then.

I started Tysabri in September 2021, so 5 months now. I have it administered by my neuro at their practice every 4 weeks. Scans show no changes and no active lesions so they want to keep me on it.

Okay so, I'm not doing so well with the health/life balance. The injections are unpleasant but I can deal with that; what I struggle with is the frequency of which I have to have them. I'm quite free spirited, I like to travel, I'm hoping to work nomadically, I like to move around.
I really struggle with feeling like I'm trapped. I'm depressed, caught between enjoying my life and taking care of my condition. I feel like I can't be myself while I'm tied to my neurologist like this. My thoughts are becoming intrusive and the deeper in the spiral I get the more I start to boil it down to numbers and stats. 

I'm increasingly worried about the risk of PML: The hospital MS outpatients repeatedly lost my results, information, cancelled appointments and actually failed to advise me correctly before my diagnosis (even when I had a scan that pointed to MS!) which resulted in a trip to A&E before I was admitted.
I'm terrified that they'll miss something vital and the mistake could be fatal in this delicate situation. 

Has anyone else switched medication or does anyone have Tysabri and have the same feelings/worries?"

I haven't been diagnosed with anything but symptoms is related to gerd/acid reflux and I'm kind of new to all of this gerd stuff. 





Last month, I had the most terrible heartburn (before taking medication) and went to see my GP next day. I told my doctor the problem and the doctor did some quick checkups like blood pressure, oximeter pulse, felt my stomach and liver, listen to my heart beat and said its all good. He then prescribed me lansoprazole 30mg and said to take them for 4 week

I took it on the first day. Nothing special happened and felt the same until on my 5th day, my symptoms gotten better to nothing. Then here is where the mistakes starts to begin. After a few days of dieting from 1-7 days, I started to eat fried food, takeaways, fish and chips, spicy foods, fizzy drinks. Nothing had happened so I thought I was all good. These capsules made hungry a lot so I always have something to eat. Began eating chocolate, crisps, sweets etc. 

I then researched online that I was meant to take it for 2 weeks since its not safe to take long term. Now this is the regret I'm feeling right now. My doctor said to take it for 4 weeks but instead, I only did for 2 weeks just because of anxiety from online. Basically thinking of the worst and negatives on ppi's.

After I stopped on week 2, I just went cold turkey after. Nothing really happened on my first week as I still ate spicy food, takeaways, you name it. Then I started to notice some burning sensation on my chest (mild but it is bothersome) and Then after I completely lost my appetite. 

Now I'm on 2nd week of stopping lansoprazole and I'm still feeling the same like No appetite and burning sensation on the chest. To be honest I don't know if this is acid rebound as somebody said that it feels like ""kicking you in the stomach every 30 seconds"") which I don't feel like that. It's more of a flare up feeling at the moment as it sounds like.

Looking back now, I feel ashamed. I should of done better and researched more. I'm now feeling sad and upset and I don't know if I'm ever gonna be healed. Feeling deepest regrets just writing this post. I should of listened to my doctor and this time I went to take this more seriously.



Coud anybody give me advice in advance. It would be greatly  appreciated. 

Will these symptoms go away?

Should I give it another go? (Think will do it anyways)

Thank you for taking your time reading. 

I will keep updating this post from now on.




Quick Update 24/12/2021: so I went to see my GP and told my mistake. He told me to do a full course this time for 4 week with lansoprazole. He then gave me a stool test for pylori. But since I haven't taken PPI'S for 2 weeks I can do it straight away before I go back to ppi's 

I noticed some symptom I had from 2 days ago. I mentioned that I had no appetite, well it came back yesterday and today aswell. I was so hungry when I was trying to sleep. At the moment, the symptoms I only have is irritation feeling in the chest. It does feeling something wrong tho. It's not painful but bothersome.

I'm hoping to get sorted out soon. I will keep posted from now on. I will let you guys know about the shit test aswell.

Update 1/15/22:

Hello all, so it's been 3 weeks since I'm on ppi's again and I'm feeling OK for starters. The only issue now is throat pain after a little cough. Usually goes away in like 3 seconds but I dont know what it could be but apart from that I'm feeling OK. Doesn't feel burning but more feeling like an ache. I've been eating better than before and drank pretty much just water nearly for a month now. I did a stool test 3 weeks ago and nothing got back to me so hopefully I assume that nothing was there. At the moment I'm tapering and stopping on the 4th week, the hopefully, I can live without them.

So, with lansoprazole, it's been all over the place. When I started I had constant diarrhea for like 4 days. Then after that I had bad constipation. I took a medicine that my dad uses when he has constipation. After that I took like 10ml of it, I had the biggest shit of my life. Big relief after that I think my stomach adjusted itself and now shitting normally I guess?. Anyways, however it messed up my mentality. I feel more tired and waking up the middle of the night. Its Tiring but I'm still fighting. I think that's it really, just affecting my mentality and energy. I think I'm low on b12, magnesium I think but idk. I'm tapering right now so hope for the best I can do this, if not then well, I have to go to the doctors again and request a endoscopy."

Anyway, Ive been in a lot of posts lately about constipation. Heres the thing: if you have IBS-C but havent had motility testing, you definitely need it. 

You could have full or partial bowel dysmotility and it be the cause of your problems. This is especially true if you dont respond to dietary changes (very high fibre) or medication (especially prescriptions). 

You need to get tested for colonic inertia (this is key). It is the first in line. There are tests to check your stomach for slow emptying (Gastroparesis), small bowel dysmotility, pelvic floor and rectal issues, as well. All of these should be in a regular work up. 

If your GI doesnt do it, you should go to a motility clinic. There are numerous but not abundant. Most teaching hospitals have one and there are directories online. You should also seek out a neurogastroenterologist.

If you have any questions about this, colonic inertia, bowel dysmotility, or my own experience, please post them here and Ill answer them all. 

There are ways to help it, but you have to know what youre treating first!

Hi everyone. My friends ex-boyfriend suffered a major psychotic break and has been in and out of mental health clinics since last year. He has had violent delusions, mostly focusing on his parents, who he has accused of stealing his organs and kidnapping him and all sorts of other things, and hes expressed desire to kill his parents. My friend says that she truly believes that if hed cast her as the villain instead of his parents, shed be dead. 

She moved into a new apartment with me and another friend. According to her, he doesnt know where she lives now, and she doesnt think he has a way of finding out. Ever since his symptoms started hes been aggressive and prone to displays of violence in front of her. She has him blocked but she can still see his texts to her on her other devices since her contacts didnt update. He recently accused her of coercing him into sex their entire decade-long relationship, and now shes really scared he is going to start fixating on her. She says he has really bad follow-through (he hasnt killed his parents, obviously) and it seems like a lot of tasks are harder for him, like she had to hire a doctor to help him sell his house because she didnt think hed be able to in his current state of mind. 

She says that violent delusions are usually uncommon in people with psychosis and/or schizophrenia, and that hes in the marginal percent that unfortunately does experience this. 

I am trying to be a good friend and be sympathetic, but Im worried, too. What are the chances that hell find our apartment? Or that hell come over here and try to hurt us? He doesnt have the address, but its easy for anyone to find an address if they put their mind to it. He has guns. If he planned it all out, he could find us easily. Im just wondering if you folks with experience feeling something similar to what hes feeling know if thats the sort of thing someone suffering from a psychotic episode would be able to carry out. 

He has not respected my friends boundaries in the past or her request for him not to contact her. 

I dont experience psychosis myself, so I dont know what its like. Im hoping you folks might be able to offer me some insight into what this guy might be experiencing when he has these paranoid, violent delusions, and whether my friend and I need to be scared for our safety here.

Before he started getting violent and aggressive, he was my friend, too. I feel really bad for him. Whatever hes going through must be terrifying for him. But my first concern is if I need to be afraid OF him. If hes in the headspace to track us down and do something violent. Any advice or insight is helpful. Thank you."

Hey all,

I have just been at my neuro and finally got confirmed what I assumed all along: I have got MS.


Well, I did quite substantial research on MS beforehand and aimed for high efficacy treatment such as Kesimpta before talking to the doctor. I was very biased towards this treatment as I assumed to have highly active MS for the following reasons: I have multiple lesions in the CNS and spinal cord; one lesion is active while the others are inactive (meaning they occured at different times). I have only had one clinically isolated syndrome however, affecting my sensibility only.

When I talked to the doctor he told me I most likely have a mild version of MS (because it affects my sensibility only) and he would suggest starting with low to mid efficacy medication: copaxone, avonex, rebif, aubagio or tecfidera. When I protested, he told me that e.g. ocrevus or kesimpta would not be paid for by the public health system -> I am living in Europe. And that high efficacy medications would mean a higher risk of side effects. Well, I told him I am aware of this and think it is still a good idea as I want to avoid any further lesions as much as possible but he argued against it (costs too much, risks too high, etc).

I want to add that this doctor is a university professor specializing on MS and often a keynote speaker at international MS congresses. So he should know what he is talking about, also in terms of current research. Still, I don't feel fully convinced and want to ask a second doctor for her recommended plan of action.


What do you think? Is it true that for ""mild"" MS high efficacy treatment is not recommended as a first drug? What are your experiences and what country/continent are you from? These information would help me to better understand his opinion.

THANKS!!


P.s.: I think the prof really didn't like me telling him his opinion is not ""state of the art"" and I am aware this was very insensitive of me to say to a prof but I really felt displeased with his explanations as most of them where about the costs, higher risks and lack of long term studies rather than efficacy of the treatment."

So some crazy stuff happened to me over the last week. I am on abilify for my psychosis and I have been suffering from depression. 

My doctor decided to prescribe me Wellbutrin 150mg first. Took it for about five days, started having extreme anxiety and dry mouth. I mentioned this to my doctor and he switched me to Lexapro 5mg. Extreme anxiety and dry mouth but something new happened this time -my fucking delusions and hallucinations came back. I had to legit tell myself my thoughts werent based on reality.

Ive been getting rashes on my face and hands in the last month and had some joint pain recently so Im getting into thinking that maybe Ive got lupus, did some tests ANA was borderline positive, the other were negative; waiting for an appointment with the PCP. I think that the rash on my face is malar however, unlike what Ive read here where people say it comes and goes, mine is constant..I have non-itchy patches of red on my forehead, cheeks and chin which are constantly there.

The skin is hot to touch (with the exception of sometimes the nose being cold but still red and the worse thing is  twice a day Id get a sort of hot flush on my face and the red will extend even more down the cheeks and up to the temples and my eyebrows. No amount of make up can hide it, let alone appease the burning feeling Im feeling. It lasts for a couple of hours.. I cant seem to pinpoint whats causing the flush. In addition to that I feel like my head is on fire even though I dont have temperature and my ears are burning all the time.. Anyone can relate to this? I know I'm getting ahead of myself but Im afraid that if the rash is so intensive, maybe it wont be alleviated with meds if I get them prescribed.. I'm attaching a picture of the rash on my forehead.

So I posted this in a comment and it was suggested that I make this info its own post. I did a bunch of research into what probiotics have shown to be effective for IBS in various research studies.

From the links below, the collective summary is that these probiotic strains (alone or in combination with others) were effective in one or more studies in reducing one or more IBS symptoms in frequency and/or severity: 

Saccharomyces Boulardii CNCM I-745 (actually a yeast), Bifidobacterium longum 35624, Bifidobacterium infantis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus plantarum 299v, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Saccharomyces cerevisiae CNCM I-3856, Bifidobacterium lactis HN019, Bifidobacterium lactis BB-12, Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM, Bifidobacterium lactis Bi-07, and Bifidobacterium bifidum MIMBb75.

I may have missed a few in the above list, but the main gist is that Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus species probiotics, as well as Saccharomyces Boulardii, are the main researched probiotics that show some kind of improvement for IBS (though it also depends on the type of IBS, and most of them helped with one or some symptoms but not all of them - see links below for more detail).

Also, many of the studies couldn't draw conclusive evidence because there just wasn't enough data/research on specific probiotics yet, or because the studies didn't fulfill certain criteria. But they were able to state what evidence they did have, and identify what is likely to be the case based on findings so far.

Bifidobacterium longum 35624 used to be called Bifidobacterium infantis 35624 and is still sometimes referred to that way. It is patented by Align, which is the brand name for that probiotic. Floraster is a leading brand name for Saccharomyces Boulardii CNCM I-745. There are other good probiotic brands too though (that have similar or different probiotic strains).

A lot of this will be trial and error as you find what works for you. Be sure to give each probiotic or probiotic blend you try at least a 4 week trial, since it takes a bit of time for your body to adjust and for the probiotics to get to a certain level in your system to start working.

It's a good idea to make sure that the probiotics are third-party tested and made in a GMC (or equivalent) registerred facility, to be sure you are getting exactly what's on the product label. I'm not sure exactly how it works in other countries, and that advice is US-based, but some level of quality assurance is generally advised.

Also, for those who aren't used to reading research papers like this, usually the important information is in the Results and/or Discussion section. Sometimes they put a summary of those near the top, and sometimes you have to scroll to the end of the article. It's also a good idea to read the abstract/summary at the top of the article so you have an idea of what the paper is about. Reading the other sections of the paper will give you more detail into what they did for the study, which will give more context, but isn't usually necessary to read the whole thing to understand the end results, which tell you what they found about the probiotics in relation to IBS.

And of course, always talk to your doctor about medical stuff! I'm just providing this information in case it might be helpful. I am NOT giving medical advice or telling you all to take probiotics or endorsing any brands or types or anything. Whether you decide to take probiotics or not is up to you and your doctor. This is just an info dump in case anyone wanted to know this stuff.

Hello! And good day to you

Been dealing with gout for ~ 2 years now. On 200 mg allo. 

Just had some anecdotes to share and see if anyone had similar experiences

Like most, the worst attacks were in the beginning while starting allopurinol; Utterly debilitating and unable to walk. The intensity of the attacks went down over time, I usually am symptom free now for months at a time with an occasional mini flare. 

Some odd things Ive noticed:
-

- sometimes if I have/had an attack it will start in 1 part of 1 of my feet. It will then migrate around my foot then eventually subside and move to my other foot

- sometimes it seems that other injuries or illnesses can trigger an attack. E.g. I got the flue and near the end of my flue symptoms a gout attack started, or on several occasions Id have a gout attack after getting another injury in my foot, (strained a muscle on the bottom of my foot when then led to an attack) 

All in all, Im lucky to have the life I have but damn, do flare ups suck.  Im in one now after the flue. Just wanted to share some thoughts.

I wish you all the best. And have a great day !"
rg91hh,t5_2qlaa,After doing some research I came across a study that found a link between [PPI use and gluten intolerance],"[{""crowd-entity-annotation"":{""entities"":[{""endOffset"":2146,""label"":""intervention"",""startOffset"":2142},{""endOffset"":2172,""label"":""outcome"",""startOffset"":2154}]}}]","GERD, PPI's & Gluten Intolorence
I wanted to share my story in hopes it could possibly help someone or there are other people going through what I'm experiencing.   
Like many others here my story began several years ago with constant nagging, gnawing heartburn for which I was prescribed Omeprazole. This seemed to remedy my symptoms, and even though I've always had a fear/aversion to being on a long-term medication before I knew it, it had been 3 years or so. Until one day the original symptoms came back, and this time way worse. I began experiencing that feeling of a fist trying to punch its way up and out of my chest. I even questioned if I had heart issues. It was pretty awful, so after several rounds of tests, including an Endoscopy, I was told I had a hiatal hernia. The GI Dr. switched me from 20 mg of Omeprazole to 40 mg and Pantoprazole and that calmed down the pain. Again, even though I was still wary of an even higher dose of daily medication, being relieved of the pain outweighed these fears and before I knew it, another 3 or so years had gone by being a slave to this drug.   
Then about a year ago I began having horrible pain in my pelvic region. I won't go into all the details, but nothing about it made me think it was a GI issue, more of a urologic issue. So after rounds of antibiotics for what they thought was prostatitis, CT scans, and even cystoscopy (if you don't know that that is look it up. Basically medieval torture!) - all of it inconclusive. I was so desperate I even tried acupuncture which did nothing. I was beginning to believe I had CPPS (chronic pelvic pain syndrome), when as a last-ditch desperate move I decided to try eliminating gluten from my diet. To my astonishment, within a little over a week, all of my symptoms magically vanished!  
I'm about 8 months into my gluten-free diet and feel great, but I began questioning what could have caused this. Why at the age of 41 did my body suddenly decide to reject gluten? I did a celiac test and it was negative and have no family history of gluten intolerance. After doing some research I came across a study that found a link between [PPI use and gluten intolerance](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3947159/) and my jaw hit the floor.  
I now believe this long-term use of PPIs has caused this and am currently in the process of trying to wean off the Pantoprazole by cutting it in half and taking it only every other day. The GERD symptoms have returned however so I've scheduled another appt with the GI Dr to discuss a way forward without PPIs. I'm holding out a small bit of hope that if I'm able to completely go off the PPPs the gluten intolerance could possibly reverse, but I know that's not likely.   
Does anyone have any alternative approaches besides the obvious diet restrictions to keep GURD at bay without this evil medication?"

I also get nauseous really easily. When I started plaquenil I would get so nauseous I threw up. Does anyone have any experience with this? My doctor made me feel confident its the right med for me but I cant help be nervous about it."

Has anyone had this IV drug? My Drs are going to give this to me on my next course of IV'S. 
It's for my PA even though it says its inactive against it. Obvs i trust my Drs that they know best & I'm having it in combo with Tobramycin. 
Just wanted a heads up on potential side effects...even though I'm aware what one gets as a side effect might be different to what i get.
Thank you."

So Im aware that there has been some research linking a lack of parasites to autoimmune conditions.
For instance, there is almost no asthma, allergies or other autoimmune disease in parts of the world where a lot of people have parasitic infections and worms; when anti-parasite medication is widely distributed to those areas, all sorts of benefits are seen from the reduction in worms and such, but also rates of asthma, allergies and other autoimmune diseases suddenly skyrocket.

Does anyone know if there are currently any trials going on into MS and parasites? Is there any existing research? Thanks!"

Okay, this is a new one for me. The last two nights as Im trying to fall asleep, my legs begin to feel like they are idling (this is the best way I can describe it). Almost like low frequency vibration. I am thinking this is RLS and it is driving me nuts.
Anyone with a similar feeling? How do you deal?"

Hey I am just wondering what peoples thoughts on the 2 studies that came out last month. The 2 studies I am referring to is the Harvard military study about how seropositivity with EBV was 99% correlated to onset of  MS diagnosis. Here is a youtube video going over it [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bkEXWg3kTw&t=1s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bkEXWg3kTw&t=1s) 

The other study is Standford research that was published in Nature that talks about that "" found evidence that up to one-fourth of people with MS had antibodies circulating in the blood and spinal fluid that recognized and bound to both a product of the EBV virus and a component of the brain cells that produce myelin""

My thoughts right now are that if the cause is found better treatments will become available which is really exciting!"

Yesterday I had an appt with a new (to me) neurologist. I sought her out bc my previous neurologist didnt take my auras seriously. He made it seem like they were normal and I should just deal with them. 

The new neurologist said that auras are absolutely seizures and if there was a way to lessen or prevent them then we should pursue it. 

I told her that I am currently prescribed 300 mg, once a day, of lamotrigine, generic. And she said that taking the generic once a day was not enough to help prevent seizures/auras and that I should be taking it twice a day, morning and night. 

Ive never had issues with any other generic drug, as that is what my insurance covers. But has anyone else found that theyve had better control of their epilepsy with name brand vs generic?"
