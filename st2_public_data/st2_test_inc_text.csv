[Structural dissociation](https://did-research.org/origin/structural_dissociation/) talks about how trauma and [emotional neglect](/r/emotionalneglect) can split a person's psyche. Emotional parts split off from the apparently normal part, and even the apparently normal part can split.

My own experiences suggest that these kinds of splits can lead to psychosis. The split off parts are not fully walled off, and especially in the right sort of triggering crisis situation, they can intrude into the experience in confusing ways. Because I didn't know those parts of myself well, and wasn't used to working with them, what happened seemed weird and partly supernatural. I wasn't used to processing that, and ended up processing it in an unreasonable way.

The difficult thing here is that when so much of myself was split off via structural dissociation, it's hard to simply ignore it. The only true healing involves finding more reasonable understanding of what happened, and accepting more parts of me back. Otherwise, I'm disabled from missing so much of myself, and disowned parts remain, and potentially cause future problems."

Hi guys,

Just turned 35 and got a flare gout since monday.  At first, I though it was from an injury in a sport event (I played volleyball tournaments twice in the week-end) but it turned out, my doc diagnose it as a gout crisis.  My question is, how you guys manage with alcohol and/or diet?  Do you just cut it all or a couples of beer with a steak on the week-end is okay?  I need to have some blood test in a couple of weeks to determine the course of the treatment but I'm kind of affraid tbh.  I though that the gout was for old whiskey drinker, turned out, its freakin not!  I'm on colchine for a couple of days, praying that gonna take the pain away for the night!"

stkk63,t5_2syer,My MIL called the manufacturer and they are claiming the high frequency thermal energy is causing the uric crystals to vibrate and they are being shaken off from the joint and going back into the bloodstream.,"High Frequency Treatment & Gout
So I've been a gout sufferer for few years and I know my triggers: beer & regular soda with sugar. And it always attacks my ankle and knee. 

Few weeks ago it was a stressful day at work on Friday and I opened the fridge without thinking and grabbed a can of Coke Zero and drank it in one gulp but in reality it was regular Coke.

Sure enough, the next morning I was feeling the tingling sensation. We happen to have the family Zoom call and my MIL who lives in Korea hears that I am suffering from gout. She tells me that she will send us something that's good for gout and I don't think much of it. By Sunday morning, I was having a full blown gout attack and my right ankle is stiff as hell. 

A package arrives on following Wed from Korea and it was this weird looking machine that looks like a foot massager. As I am reading the manual, it sounds like a total snake oil. It talks about how cancer happens more often to those that have lower body temperature and raising 1 degree celsius in your core body temperature can reduce the risk of cancer by more than 50%. It also talks about how the high frequency current that's emitted from this machine creating thermal energy will make the cells in your body vibrate and help with all types of joint pains. By then I was fully convinced this was a fraud and I called me MIL and was like I ain't falling for this horseshit and told her I will be sending it  for her to get a refund. But she's adamant that I give it a try since someone else that she knows who was suffering from gout big time has been using the same machine and it has helped significantly.

So I decide to give it a try. Within a minute or two, you can feel the warmth and as times goes by, I am feeling this tiny shocks all over my feet and within 15 mins I am sweating like I ran a marathon. 

About an hour after I finish the session, I can feel the stiffness on my ankle subsiding just a little bit. I wanted to try it once again but the manual says only to do one 30 min session every 12 hours. So the next morning as soon as I woke up, I did it again and sure enough, I gained more flexibility around my ankle to the point where I was able to grab it and crack my ankle which usually is the sign that my gout is going away. This normally happens about a week after the full attack starts. But with this device, I was pain free within 48 hours and everything was back to normal. 

To test if this was not just a placebo effect, I drank 2 cans of beer few days later but it didn't cause an attack and I am afraid to try again for obvious reasons. I even sent out a message to people that I know in my area to see if anyone was suffering from gout and if so, come and try this machine to see if it actually works for them as well.  

By no means, I am trying to start a controversy or gain anything materially from this (I am not even posting anything particular about the product and googling won't help either) but anyone else has heard about high frequency thermal treatment for gout? My MIL called the manufacturer and they are claiming the high frequency thermal energy is causing the uric crystals to vibrate and they are being shaken off from the joint and going back into the bloodstream. I know high frequency treatment exists for acne but I've never heard such thing for gout. Any input will be greatly appreciated."

Im planning on making an appointment with a specialist soon to confirm as I feel the doctor at the urgent care couldve been a much better help. Ive read some stories here that people develop more GERD symptoms after taking prescribed PPIs and withdraw from them. Is short term use safe? Also is there any recommended herbs or natural remedies that anyone would recommend?

si3xr0,t5_2s23e,"Gut bacteria can affect the immune system, and diet influences gut bacteria","Certain gut bacteria, and high meat consumption, may increase risks for MS, study shows
If you eat a lot of meat, you may be at increased risk for multiple sclerosis, a new study suggests.

MS is an autoimmune disease in which the body attacks the insulation around nerves. It's not clear what triggers the attack, but mounting evidence suggests bacteria plays a role. Gut bacteria can affect the immune system, and diet influences gut bacteria.

**To learn more about the interplay of diet, gut bacteria, the immune system and MS, researchers studied 25 MS patients and 24 people without the disease.**

*""We found a number of gut bacteria associated with MS and severity of disability of MS patients,""* said study author Dr. Yanjiao Zhou, an assistant professor of medicine at UConn Health School of Medicine in Farmington, Conn.

*""We also found increased autoimmune markers and signature metabolites in MS. But what is really interesting is how these systems connect with each other, and how diet is involved in these connections,""* Zhou said in a University of Connecticut news release.

***Eating more meat, having lower levels of certain bacteria in the gut, and more of certain immune cells in the blood were all associated with MS, according to the report published online recently in the journal EBioMedicine.***

**Higher meat consumption, which was found in the MS patients, was linked with lower gut levels of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron -- a bacteria involved with digesting carbohydrates from vegetables.**

Higher meat consumption was also related to an increase in T-helper 17 cells in the immune system, and an increase in S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) in the blood.

The researchers said the findings suggest that in people with MS, something disconnects their gut bacteria from the immune system, resulting in autoimmune attacks on the nervous system. This sequence tends to be associated with meat-eating, they suggested.

According to study author Dr. Laura Piccio, *""This is the first study using an integrated approach to analyze the interplay between diet, gut microbiome, the immune system and metabolism"" and their contribution to MS development. Piccio is an associate professor of neurology at the University of Sydney who was previously at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis.*

The authors want to expand their research to include more people, including patients with a more severe form of MS. The aim is to learn more about the interaction of diet, gut bacteria and the immune system in MS to possibly prevent the disease or ease symptoms.

It progressed over the next couple of days until I ended up in ER because I had trouble walking.  I was diagnosed with Guillain-Barré Syndrome and started on IVIG immediately.  After a 10 day hospital stay (including rehab) I was luckily able to walk out of the hospital.

I am in no way indicating that this was brought on by starting allo as I truly believe the timing was coincidental.  So here I am- pcp and Neuro both saying ok to restart Allo but my head is obviously reeling.  I did have them run an SUA the day before I left and it was 7.9.  Ive not yet had any flares but thinking possibly because of IVIG.

I found two very small studies, one indicating a difference in pts with GBS and SUA levels being much lower than controls.  The other one I found showed higher CSF levels of UA.  One or two case studies show allo association with myositis (obviously not what I had).

Negative Lupis, RA, thyroid etc. He said my symptoms are more inline with a deficiency of some sort but labs were fine and he didnt like that I had fascinations, especially in the face, or leg tremors when holding them up as instructed. Thats when he mentioned MS as a possibility and has ordered an MRI of the brain and spine.

Im grateful I was able to have an appointment with a neurologist so quickly, and one that was surprisingly thorough. Im aware that this could be caused by something completely other than MS, but it has been something at the back of mind. I just turned 31, so Im a bit anxious and nervous but ready for answers. And if it does turn out it is MS, Im hoping a long battle for diagnosis and treatment isnt the norm post MRI."

rotm5s,t5_2qlaa,I know bloat can be a cause of endo belly,"Can these extreme symptoms be gerd?
37, female. I had my endometriosis surgery on Nov 30th. Been very sick from general anesthesia for 3 days. Excessive vomiting. Then I felt OK and was sent home. At home I've felt fine for about 4 days and then out of the blue extreme bloating and a feeling like something is stuck in my throat appeared. Like an air bubble that doesn't go away. Also having shortness of breath and chest pressure. Inhaling deeply is hard. My saturation is fine. I don't have a fever. Spoke to my gp and she says it might be my thyroid or costochondritis. 
I get really anxious when the chest tightness is at its worst. Ill have to do breathing excersises to not go into full panic and hyperventilation. It's been there everyday for at least a week now. 

The bloating and chest tightness seem to go hand in hand. The bloating is pretty severe. I know bloat can be a cause of endo belly. A lot of women who suffer endometriosis get extreme bloat. But surgery removed all of the endometriosis. So it's weird that it would appear again this quickly. 

Can this be gerd? I don't have a burning sensation in the throat or chest. I do have it off and on near my diaphragm. I also do not have a bad taste in my mouth. I do have very dry mouth. But since its so tight I'm in constant panic mode. The shortness of breath is horrible."

At least as sharp as can be all things considered.

As I believe tends to happen  with MS, I've caught my brain slipping more often than I'd like. Things like forgetting words, misplacing items, difficulty to stay focused or difficulty to finish sentences.

So as a way to keep my brain active, I ve started trying to learn Japanese on a language learning phone app. Foreign language with a foreign  script, should keep my brain busy enough, right?

I also try to read as much as possible, I feel like it keeps my vocabulary  in check. I recently started Marcus Aurelius  Meditations, so maybe next time my brain slips, it looks slip into something noble and honorable.

I (26F) had suffered with severe heartburn for years, but Tums, Pepto and a glass of milk seemed to help. In January 2021, I had severe, sharp, crushing chest pain that radiated to my teeth and back and I thought I was having a heart attack. I went to the ER and they did all the cardiac blood tests,  an EKG, and a D-Dimer to look for clots. Everything checked out normal and they sent me home, only for it to happen over and over. Sometimes I would get one every day, and sometimes I wouldn't get one for weeks. I suffered with those pains all through the summer, until I finally reached out to my PCP in November. After some discussion she diagnosed me with GERD, and told me my chest pains were esophageal spasms. She had me take Zantac-360 for six weeks, which helped with the heartburn but overall didn't stop the spasms.

Last Saturday (1/1/22) I began having severe stomach pains along with a spasm. It felt like a hot fist just clenching in my stomach over and over. I had some chest heaviness with it, and my anxiety was through the roof. I dealt with it for a few  days and finally went in yesterday to get it checked out, with a new doctor. She did labs on me (all normal), and prescribed me Protonix for six weeks to see if that would ultimately stop my spasms, stomach pain and heartburn. I've done some research on Protonix and noticed some people have severe side effects - some people have mild - and some have none at all. I took my first pill last night and I'm feeling a little anxious as to what might happen. I worry about heart palpitations and seizures, as my family has a history of heart issues.

How many of you have been on Protonix? What were your experiences? Are there short-term side effects or do the most serious side effects only occur if you are on it long-term?

Also, if anyone has any input on esophageal spasms or the chest pains associated with GERD, I'd love to hear any advice/stories on that too. This has been the scariest part for me. I've spent nights wide awake praying for my heartburn to come back full force instead of having to feel another spasm. It's gotten to the point where sometimes I'm scared to go to sleep because I wonder ""what if it isn't a spasm this time?""

Any advice, words of wisdom, comfort, tips and tricks...anything will help at this point. Sorry if this is alot, I appreciate anyone who read this!!"

Since this will be done by my orthopedist not a rheumatologist I don't know if she will have the experience to see these things anyway. 

Just curious about other's experience with US guided toe injections, and especially whether they have visualized any of these things in your gouty toe. I have had other US injections so the procedure won't bother me. I'm getting it because even when I'm not flaring I have some arthritic symptoms in that toe, especially at night, and I want to see if this will eliminate them.

s7x2op,t5_2s23e,Hydroxychloroquine being researched as a potential treatment option for primary progressive multiple sclerosis,"Hydroxychloroquine being researched as a potential treatment option for primary progressive multiple sclerosis
 A research team led by Dr. Marcus Koch and Dr. Wee Yong (Co-Founder and Chief Scientific Officer of AnthoBio) at the University of Calgary that investigates a generic drug, hydroxychloroquine, in primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) recently published its clinical study results in Annals of Neurology. The study followed 35 PPMS patients over a period of five years. Throughout the study, 14 patients were expected to develop a significant reduction in their walking function. However, only 8 patients had experienced a reduction by the end of the study. Thats almost a 50% reduction in the number of PPMS patients negatively affected by continuing disability. Although the results will require confirmation in a larger trial, this study has shown that hydroxychloroquine could help slow down the disability progression of PPMS. This study opens the possibility for future treatment option for PPMS and the researchers hope their work will inspire future larger scale clinical research on the drug for PPMS.

","Misdiagnosis
*As it was explained to me by my doctor, serotonin is used between immune system cells to communicate and activate immune system responses within the body. Taking an ssri altered these responses in me. 


My original diagnosis was based on three things: first, a change in vision. Then an MRI where they found 20-30 lesions, then a lower lumbar puncture to confirm my immune system was attacking me. I was placed on tysabri and given one-two MRIs per year since 2015. However, the head doctor of the largest multiple sclerosis center closest to me was reluctant to diagnosis me until the lumbar puncture because he believed several of my other symptoms were indicative of severe reactions to an ssri I was on, and as I continued to go to them with symptoms, he continued to iterate that. I had several exacerbations over the years and an MRI following each one, and each MRI came back the same with no new lesions. My vision issues actually continued (the exacerbations) despite there being no progress on lesions, and over time it became apparent to me that we were all, including me, overlooking something else- I have terrible eye contact habits and was suffering from inner eye infections so once I began to get treated for those, my vision problems became preventable. It takes years to taper off of the ssri safely, which I did, and its been several years since Ive been on it. It was explained to me that the ssri changed the environment in my stomach which changed the way my immune system responded, causing an immune system disorder but not real autoimmunity. I do have another lower lumbar puncture coming up to confirm my immune system response. Perhaps Im over-excited until then, but being told by doctors that it was because of the ssri and a resulting immune system disorder because it changed the biome in my gut has been eye-opening."

rv7vmp,t5_2qlaa,'ve read stories about people having this kind of stuff happen WHILE they're taking it,"PPI withdrawal heart side effects?
I've been dealing with reflux and gastritis since June of 2020 so I started taking omeprazole (which screwed up my stomach BIG TIME and I'm convinced is actually what ruined my body instead of my minor nighttime reflux I started taking it for).

After months of dealing with that I tried dropping it for something else, but I started getting major heart palpitations and would wake up with my heart racing like 120-130bpm. It would keep happening throughout the day but all my doctors said it was anxiety (since I've had issues with that most of my life) but I know my body well enough to know the difference.

I hopped onto 40mg pantoprazole and some daily anxiety meds from a psychiatrist which seemed to make the heart stuff go away at first and my stomach improved just from getting off the omeprazole, but I still havent been able to really eat and the 'correct foods' are still bothering me. 

Long story short, I've messed with my panto doses like 3 times and each time after a few days of either pausing it or cutting it in half I've had all the heart stuff come back, even with me still taking my anxiety meds. I did have a lot of testing done last year from my cardio (granted everything I did came after I got the meds so my heart had calmed down) which all came back normal, but when I ask my doctors about these side effects from stopping PPIs they all just kinda look at me, shrug, and say I'm a weird case and it's anxiety.

I've got a new GI doc who seems nicer and wants to get me off them onto some famotidine, but in the process of weaning off getting there to try that I'm back to the same square of a constant racing heart and palpitations. It's been almost two weeks now and the only thing kinda keeping them in check is me taking my emergency panic attack meds.

I've read stories about people having this kind of stuff happen WHILE they're taking it, but has anyone had any bad side effects getting off them like this? I kinda just need to know I'm not alone since my other doctors all point at each other in a circle and say 'ask that one'."

Hi guys,

I wanted to find out if any diagnostic tests helped find a cause for your GERD. 

I am going to the GI doctor again to figure out the root cause of acid reflux since it just doesn't make sense to me that young people with normal weights etc. can be suffering like this. I read a lot of healthy 20 years old in this reddit community that have struggled with GERD for years and years. I had a endoscope last year that showed redness in my esophagus and all the GI doctor did was hand me a prescription for PPIs, hello, we know that PPIs should not be used longer than like 6 weeks and can make the issue worse. 

Anyway, I want to know what tests to ask for at the GI doctor that may find the root cause of GERD I am going soon and I want to advocate for myself.

I've tried PPIs, gaviscon advance, magnesium supplements, probiotics, zinc carosine, DGL licorice, etc. But still am having constant chest and back pain and sore throats. 

I'm thinking of asking for a test to test for SIBO, IBD/IBS, Candida, and Stool Test.

 Anything else?

A couple of weeks ago my put me on Seroquel, that helped me a lot with sleep and my hallucinations.

I just switched to a new psychiatrist because my  old one was full of red flags.
When I told her about my dissociation episodes she told me that is was from psychosis and a way to protect me from my traumas.

Sorry for the long post but hoping for some advice. I've been having what I think are symptoms of POTS since I had covid last summer, high jump in heart rate on standing up (goes from 75 resting to 130 just on standing up and walking downstairs, and stays high while I'm standing), headaches, fatigue, tinnitus etc. In the UK, you get referred to a ""post covid clinic"" where they decide via telephone appointment what tests/referrals you need, and I was only referred to go for a ""lying to standing blood pressure"" test which was done today.

The nurse didn't seem to have a clue what was needed. She asked if I wanted to lie down or stand first(???), then got me to lay down and immediately took my blood pressure. I was laid down less than 2 minute before she asked me to stand and immediately took blood pressure again, once. It didn't feel like there was any time for my body to adjust to the change in position before any readings were taken. Both were normal, but she didn't look at my heart rate at all, even when I mentioned it was racing. 

As it stands, this result will go back to the post covid nurse who will review it in 6-8 weeks, but I'm not sure that what was done today will show anything at all. Are there particular tests that I should be pushing for that will confirm or negate that this is POTS? I do have the option of using private health cover, but need to know what type of specialist I need, and what type of tests I am asking for. I find it much easier to be assertive with medical professionals if I know what I actually want them to do.

COVID has been hard enough on job opportunities, but he has over a year gap in his resume and has been working part time retail jobs more recently. However, he feels like he might have a seizure now and then and this means he leaves work early. I fear they are cutting his hours because they don't see him as reliable.

What programs are there to help find employment? He's interested in IT, working from home at any capacity, or anything without too much physical labor. 

Are there any programs to give him a disability status that can be used to leverage more sick days at work?

If so, does it completely bar him from holding a driver's license? His seizures are well managed, but the dosages/meds he has needs tweaking since weight gain. He has gone almost a year before without seizures when he was thinner, so I'm hoping we can try and keep his rights to a license.

s9dzea,t5_2s23e,Ive read that this and other common side effects subside within a week or two,"Gabapentin & neuropathy
Hi everyone,

Im relatively new here, but Ive found so much helpful advice since I was diagnosed in December (33/fRRMS). Thank you!! 

Today I take my second loading dose of Kesimpta. I saw my neuro on Wednesday, and she prescribed me gabapentin to help with neuropathy in my hands, thighs, and the bottoms of my feet. She said I can take up to 900mg a day, or 3 pills, depending on how I feel. Kind of vague instructions, but there you goIm not sure that its that kind of drug, i.e. one that has a relatively immediate effect, like ibuprofen, but perhaps I misunderstood her. 

Ive taken one gabapentin before bed the past two nights. I know a side effect is drowsiness, but it makes me sooo drowsylike fall-asleep-sitting-up drowsy. 

Ive read that this and other common side effects subside within a week or two, and I really want to try this drug to see if it helps; I work with books and, uh, use my hands a lot! My hands (mostly fingers) are by far the worst, and the sudden onset of neuropathy in my fingers is the reason I sought medical tests in the fall.  The numbness and/or tingling has been driving me insane. It has been consistent in my hands since a week before Halloween (and same with skin on my stomachnot sure if its the MS hug, however), and more recently + less intensely it has been on my thighs and the bottom of my feet.  Some days are worse than others, which Ive definitely learned is normal from reading posts on here. Blah! 

Back to gabapentin: I am hesitant to take a second pill mid-afternoon prior to the one before bed, simply because it had made me so tired the last couple of nights. I really dont want to fall asleep in the middle of the dayone reason I dont take Benadryl, no matter how bad allergies are, unless Im going to bed! 

In short: has anyone here ever taken gabapentin? What was or is your experience like? Thank you for any advice or comments."

she basically told me that since im not losing weight rapidly and because my blood work came back normal that there was no need to do any further testing and that we can just manage the my symptoms with medications but thats not what i want. she told me just follow the low fodmap diet and go for a walk everyday, but i already go on walks everyday and i get diarrhea and intense stomach pain no matter what i eat. ive tried eating low fodmap foods and even if i totally cut out the foods im not supposed to eat i get diarrhea. i want a doctor who is going to listen to me and actually work with me to find the source of my problems instead of just saying you have ibs, sorry cant do anything for you!

I was wondering if I could run something by you, guys. Maybe someone is in a similar boat.

I recently got my third Covid vaccine, and like some of you, I have been wondering how effective it has been. I read a study awhile back, that concluded that those of us on Gilenya might not be so fortunate when it comes to antibodies. So, I asked my doctor (not a neuro) should I check mine. She said that the national health bureau (in Finland) doesnt recommend that but she put the request in the system, if I want to go for the blood test.

But is it beneficial? Does it actually matter, if Im already masking and socially distancing? Have you guys checked your antibody - levels and has that actually lead to anything?"

Sometimes the CF community in general can get a bit negative, so I just wanted to open up an opportunity for people to share some positive experiences they may have had in relation to CF.

Was there a time someone made a generous accommodation for you to help manage your CF or because of your CF?

Did you have an experience you wouldn't have otherwise had?

Did a relationship take on a different level because of your experiences with CF?

For me, a time that stands out is when I was in Grade 10. I was a hardworking student who had maintained straight A's since starting junior high in Grade 8. I'd been in the hospital several times throughout those 3 years, but had always managed to keep up while I was away. At the end of Grade 10, I was hospitalized at a time when my Math class was just starting a new subject. I studied on my own as best I could, but I missed almost all of the instruction on the subject. When it came time for the test, I got a much lower score than usual, and it put my overall mark down to a B. I mentioned in passing to my Math teacher that I was sad to have my ""streak"" broken. We had a discussion about the subject of the test where she confirmed that I did understand it sufficiently. Without telling me, she went into her records, looked at all my previous test scores, and came up with an average, which is what she assigned me as a score on that final test. This brought my mark back up to an A, and the streak continued! It was such a sweet thing for her to do, and I've never forgotten it. I continued my straight A streak right up to the end of high school and graduated with scholarships to go to university!"

qm36j3,t5_2syer,"Possible inaccuracies notwithstanding, my home testing has suggested a general downward trend in my UA","my home testing results
Possible inaccuracies notwithstanding, my home testing has suggested a general downward trend in my UA. I started testing in late September after having 2 flares in September. At the same time I completely quit all of my known triggers (salmon, trout) and my possible triggers (seafood, pie) and in fact all animal flesh protein. I already hadn't had a drink since early August (wasn't  a heavy drinker but did like a shot or two of rum most nights). Getting my protein from eggs, nuts and dairy and probably a few other  non-meat things now.  Drinking more milk and a little tart cherry juice most days. Over the last couple weeks I have added wine back in, and that hasn't seemed to affect my UA at all. 

 Since I was flaring much of September my initial readings may have been lower than my normal, but we'll never know. What I do know is

Over the first 2 weeks I averaged 6.9 and a lab test October 4 came back at 6.9

Over the 28 days I averaged 6.5. 

Over the last 2 weeks I averaged 6.1

And today the lab tested me at 6.2. So I seem to have dropped 0.7 mg/dl in 28 days, assuming they are spot-on. (I think they are supposed to be within 0.2)

So despite the limitations of the meter, which I can't seem to rely on for a daily reading, it does seem to mirror the lab results when its all averaged out over longer time frames. The downward trend I seemed to be seeing seems to have been real. 

My big toe is still sore off and on, and I'm having a cortisone injection tomorrow. Its possible I have lasting damage there; my first flare was in March 2017. I am not on allo but allo is on my kitchen counter, ready. Since I have zero family history of gout and I kept notes after all of my flares, I know my triggers pretty well and am going to see if I can get my UA even lower in the next month."
scuolp,t5_2s23e,3 months ago the Dr told me I didn't need treatment unless I was having frequent relapses,"Dr: 'There's no point being on treatment unless you're having relapses'. Me: Loses feeling in right arm.
Sorry for the ridiculous title, but that's basically what's happened.

Here's my old post for context
https://www.reddit.com/r/MultipleSclerosis/comments/pz4q4o/no_treatment/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share 

3 months ago the Dr told me I didn't need treatment unless I was having frequent relapses. After getting advice from you guys I called the hospital I'm at and spoke to a nurse about getting treatment, because that seemed wrong. It was a no from her as well. 

So I thought I'd wait it out for 3 months until I get to my appointment with the neuro next week. Where I'd push for treatment (as would my partner) - and if it was still a no then I'd find a new Dr. 

So what happened 3 days ago? I lost feeling in my right arm 

Still hasn't come back, and now it feels like it's full of freezing cold water which is horribly uncomfortable. The sensation of temperature in my arm is so messed up, hot things feel vaguely warm and anything slightly cold feels painfully cold - like a block of ice. 

I am currently awake at 2am because its just so uncomfortable. 

So right now I don't know whether to laugh or cry. I'm absolutely furious that this has been allowed to happen and I'm scared about how long I'll be dealing with this horrible feeling. But there's also a part of me that finds it slightly funny... Is that crazy? I mean, I work on a computer all day and I can't even feel the keys??

I'm genuinely anticipating going into my appointment and having him say I'm totally fine/it's anxiety/I don't need treatment/deal with it etc. In which case I'll hit him with my stick and find someone new. 

Anyway, just wanted to vent. I only got diagnosed 6 months ago and I am already absolutely fucking done with this illness and fucking done trying to fight for every scrap of support. (Oh- still haven't had a single physio session after losing feeling from the chest down 6 months ago, and have taught myself to walk again- slowly and painfully, after leaving the hospital with nothing and buying my mobility aids from Amazon)

Ps- I'm in the UK if that's at all relevant. I've been told you have to meet quite strict criteria to be eligible for treatment, which as of yet, I apparently haven't.

UPDATE-
Gone to the walk in centre to get steroids because I can't feel my arm. They told me that if it's just sensory I need to deal with it and they aren't going to give me any treatment.

Apparently not being able to feel my dominant arm is a non issue.

I give up."

Male, 5'9, 180lbs, active lifestyle, casual drinker, healthy diet

Been lurking around reading all the recommendations from you guys. Very appreciative of the tips.

Have some questions for anyone out there who is able to help.

Was feeling foot pain and my family doctor refereed me to a podiatrist who stated it's most likely gout.  I initially thought it was a bunion. Got x-rays and blood work done. X-rays negative for arthritis or broken bones but blood work showed my results as, A538. Reference range should be 150-430.

Flare ups  come and go and last approximately 2-3 days.  I took 2 weeks off work and that really helped relieve pressure on the foot. I went back into work this week and on the third day back, it started to flare up again. I'm required to wear ankle high boots at work and i'm wondering if that may be a factor for the flare ups?

&#x200B;

So few questions,

&#x200B;

1) Are the work boots a factor? Does anyone else have a similar experience?

2) Based off the blood work results of 538 and the maximum range is 430. What steps should I be taking to help lower that number?

3) Based off what i've read, it sounds like allopurinol seems to be helpful so I plan on contacting my family doctor for a prescription for that."

spyqsp,t5_2s3g1,"From what I have read, IBS usually presents with pain which I have none of.  ","1st Colonoscopy Next Week-A Bit Nervous on My Symptoms
Hi all-

Late thirties, male.  A bit of a control freak about my health which is probably why I am down the rabbit hole and worried about this scope next week.

I have always had on/off constipation but typically without any real pain.  Naturally, some discomfort but nothing I would consider pain.  Typically, I would barely go during the week then have a couple normal BMs on the weekend.  I travel a lot and usually eat high protein/a bit short on fiber diet so I do not think much of this.  A couple months ago though, I started having smaller stools and not having my weekend BM's.  When I do have them, they can look sometimes odd shaped with indentions, sometimes square edges and typically no bigger than walnuts although sometimes I get half-way normal looking ones that are about 3 inches in length.  TMI I am sure.  For my diet, I eat spinach and blueberries literally everyday in a shake so the color of everything is usually darker shade of brown but certainly not black. 

Anyways, last couple of weeks I have really upped the fiber to the 38gm/day typically and I have been having BMs daily but, they are still in pieces.  No straining 99% of them time and they just come out clean but, in pieces.  In regards to blood, only once have I seen pink blood on the TP after the day prior I did have to strain and had what I would call a peanut BM.  Have not seen anything else.  Please keep in mind I exercise daily, eat 160-190gm protein/day and around 130gm carbs/day along with 50gm/fat.  Last 2 weeks i have used metamucil and chia seeds to see if it helps.

Went to the GI and expected them to listen to my diet and tell me to try miralax or something else but instead, they talked to me for 5 minutes and decided I should get a colonoscopy.  Based on lots of the info I have read here, that seems strange since some of you guys seem to have to demand one.  So naturally, it makes me nervous to think the docs expect something more sinister but they insisted it was more to rule things out.

So, end of next week I get my first colonoscopy.  From what I have read, IBS usually presents with pain which I have none of.  This makes me a bit anxious.  **Have any of you experienced similar symptoms minus ""pain"" and it been nothing?**  I Have no family history of the big C but, my mom/grandmother/aunt does struggle with bowel issues and mainly constipation so I am hoping I just get it honest.  One of the things that is keeping me somewhat positive is that I had CT scans about 16 months ago for something unrelated and there was nothing in my pelvic/abdomen.  Of course, things can change but at least back then they saw zero.

Sorry for the novel but, really anxious and somewhat neurotic about this."

Hi everyone,

Im relatively new here, but Ive found so much helpful advice since I was diagnosed in December (33/fRRMS). Thank you!! 

Today I take my second loading dose of Kesimpta. I saw my neuro on Wednesday, and she prescribed me gabapentin to help with neuropathy in my hands, thighs, and the bottoms of my feet. She said I can take up to 900mg a day, or 3 pills, depending on how I feel. Kind of vague instructions, but there you goIm not sure that its that kind of drug, i.e. one that has a relatively immediate effect, like ibuprofen, but perhaps I misunderstood her. 

Ive taken one gabapentin before bed the past two nights. I know a side effect is drowsiness, but it makes me sooo drowsylike fall-asleep-sitting-up drowsy. 

Ive read that this and other common side effects subside within a week or two, and I really want to try this drug to see if it helps; I work with books and, uh, use my hands a lot! My hands (mostly fingers) are by far the worst, and the sudden onset of neuropathy in my fingers is the reason I sought medical tests in the fall.  The numbness and/or tingling has been driving me insane. It has been consistent in my hands since a week before Halloween (and same with skin on my stomachnot sure if its the MS hug, however), and more recently + less intensely it has been on my thighs and the bottom of my feet.  Some days are worse than others, which Ive definitely learned is normal from reading posts on here. Blah! 

Back to gabapentin: I am hesitant to take a second pill mid-afternoon prior to the one before bed, simply because it had made me so tired the last couple of nights. I really dont want to fall asleep in the middle of the dayone reason I dont take Benadryl, no matter how bad allergies are, unless Im going to bed! 

In short: has anyone here ever taken gabapentin? What was or is your experience like? Thank you for any advice or comments."

I posted a few weeks back about my 2nd (suspected) gout attack.  On July 13, I went to my PCP and my Urate level/blood test was 7.2 and PCP said that was normal.  At the time of my appointment, the pain had subsided a bit and my toe was not red/swollen/warm so PCP was not convinced it was gout.  The flareup came back that night with a vengeance (it is always worse at night) and I demanded a referral to a rheumatologist.  After reading all about gout here and on other online resources, I see others saying that 7.2 is not normal and is actually high.

I went to a rheumatologist today and she agreed that what I described was almost definitely gout but some of what she said surprised me/contradicted some of what I've read here and just wanted to get everyone's thoughts.

1- she said that gout is not diagnosed by Urate blood test and instead is diagnosed by either taking fluid from the joint during flare up or by looking at Xrays.  My flare up is over so she ordered Xrays.

2- I thought for sure she would prescribe Allo but she gave me a choice - start Allo right away or wait until Xray results come back and then she will have a better idea if its needed and also a better idea of dosage.   She prescribed Colchicine in case I get another flare-up before I go back to see her in 6 weeks after Xrays.  I chose to wait, get Xrays and see what they reveal.

3- I asked if Allo can cause flares when you first start taking it and she said that is a myth/not true.

Regardless, I am glad I went and that I am on the right track and she did emphasize many times that gout is very manageable/treatable.

Thanks,

So, I am hoping that the problematic ingredients giving me itchy red patches that don't fade is the glacial acetic acid which is NOT in Kesimpta. But it could also be the polysorbate, which is in both. By my own deduction, the irritating ingredient is the one which purpose it is to make the drug release gradually. Because it gets worse after 7-10th day after injection.

I am afradit I will fight for this drug and end up with the same reactions. My doctor told me I am THE ONLY ONE of his patients having local site reactions to Plegridy. Which is strange, because he said he has many patients on Plegridy and I found that according to leaflet 66% of patients have it. And only around 11% have local site reactions to Kesimpta, which is hopeful to me

I will appreciate any thoughts - reassurance from those who don't local site reaction, or replies from those who do have, or any experience going from interferon to Kesimpta.

My doctor is not of much help with this, they just suggested K-vitamin cream, which does nothing, because my skin is irritated and not bruised. They see a bruise and think it is a bruise. What helps a little bit are antihistamine cream and pills, but I don't want to take the pill every day and it doesn't help that much.

Thank you"

qxkh0f,t5_2syer,GP thought gout in ankle was unlikely and that I had maybe injured my Achilles,"Ankle / achilles
Looking for others' experience while I await blood test results...

I had one confirmed case of gout 6 years ago in my toe. On Monday this week I had similar unbearable pain but in my ankle, initially felt like achilles but the pain was so bad I nearly passed out. Subsequently felt like front of ankle.

The next day my GP gave me cochicine with blood tests taken today which will take at least a week for results. GP thought gout in ankle was unlikely and that I had maybe injured my Achilles.

However, remarkably the pain has almost gone after 3 days of cochicine. Is this consistent with other people's experience of gout? I've never had cochicine before but was convinced the pain was nearly identical to the previous gout flare up."
