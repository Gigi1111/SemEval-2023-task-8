When I was 17, it was a very good year. Like the opening line of the old Frank Sanatra song, when I was 17, it truly was a very good year. I was getting ready to graduate high school, I had deeply bonded friends, I loved where I lived, and I had amazing parents.  

Growing up I was an only child with older parents, which is probably why I like Frank Sanatras music, and knew I could do or be anything I wanted. After graduating High School, I went to the local community college, moved in with my boyfriend at the time, and had a pretty standard start to adult-hood. It seems like so long ago now, but one morning I woke up and my left side wasnt responding as fast as my right side. It felt heavy, it was hard to wash my hair, it lasted a few hours, then went away. This went on for several days, and when I mentioned it to my mom, her response was, Youre going to the emergency room!!

After several hours at the hospital, several days of blood tests, an MRI, and a false test result of hepatitis C, I was referred to a neurologist who suspected MS, but wanted to do a spinal tap. My mom flat out refused, and we drove an hour to see a neurologist who specialized in MS. She took one look at my MRI and confirmed the diagnosis (only a few days after my 21st birthday). She recommended Copaxone, and told me that it was good they caught it early and that I should still lead a relatively normal life.

De-Nial is NOT just a river in Egypt.

I went home feeling a bit shocked, a lot overwhelmed, and A LOT of denial.

Looking back I realize that, what the doctor said is probably true for someone on the other side of a diagnosis like MS. Even today almost twenty years later, if Im sitting down, most people cant tell I have anything wrong with me. I dont look sick.

I went on with my life as usual. Relapsing Remitting MS is a horrible monster, it lulls you into a false sense of security, believing nothing is really wrong. My original symptoms had resolved and I went on as I always had. I wasnt great about taking the Copaxone everyday, what 21 year old wants to give themselves a shot every day when they feel fine?

De-Nial is NOT just a river in Egypt.

I had a few exacerbations that were treated with steroids over the next several years, but always my symptoms went away and I went back to life as usual. Three years after my diagnosis I met my future husband, he proposed and I moved 1,100 miles away from California to Colorado. We had, and continue to have, a good life (even if everything is harder now). We used to hike and camp and do all the things young active people are known to do. Four years later my MS acts up again and my doctor changes my Copaxone to Tysabri. I responded very well to the Tysabri and once again, all my symptoms abated.

At this point, ten years after my diagnosis, I still felt pretty good. I did get tired easily, and I did notice I couldnt handle the heat as well as I used to, but overall, yes, I lead a normal life. I thought things would continue on this way indefinitely. I was told that the first ten years were the worst and if symptoms and lessons could be kept under control, I should continue to do well.

De-Nial is NOT just a river in Egypt.

After being on Tysabri for three or four years, I stopped responding, and was put on Rituxan. This time, the symptoms did not resolve. I continued to have numbness in my hands and feet, bad vertigo, and slow response on my left side. The symptoms had come full circle, landing back where they started, in my left leg and arm.

While the Rituxan has held the line in the sense that I have no new lesions in the last several years. I have slowly gotten worse. I went from being able to walk relatively well for several blocks, to walking very slowly with a cain and bad limp, then walking with a walker very short distances and using a chair when we leave the house. The numbness in my hands is extremely frustrating, and my balance is pretty much non existent. I cant walk over a totally flat surface without holding onto something. I cant cook elaborate holiday meals like I used to, I simply cant stand up that long, and Ive started using those electric carts when I have to go to the grocery store. I have gone from a full-time job, to part time, because my body wont put up with anything more. I feel like a burden to my husband, who continues to love me anyway, without complaint.  

Why do we believe denial is an effective approach to monumental changes like a diagnosis of a chronic illness?

3,re7owg,t5_2s1h9,"Had a seizure for the first time in ten years
Ten years ago, when I was 20, I had two seizures about a month apart. Several doctors and god knows how many tests later, we never figured out what caused them. I tried a few different meds, all of which caused terrible side effects, so I just stopped them all and eventually stopped trying to figure out what happened. A decade passed and I chalked it up to some weird fluke. 

Then on Thursday morning I was sitting at my desk at work and out of nowhere, a tonic-clonic seizure. I very gracefully smacked my face into my desk so now I have a black eye and knocked out veneer (yay $2k down the drain!) and threw my shoulder out when I jerked my arm. Luckily my office has security cams so I and the doctors were able to see what actually happened, since my coworker simply found me passed out on the floor. 

Im not looking for any kind of diagnosis here or anything, just some support. Im frustrated and scared and know Im going to have to go through a million tests again now. They did a CT scan at the hospital and it was totally normal, along with all my blood work and the chest X-ray and EKG. They put me on 1000mg/day of Keppra and I have an appointment with a neurologist on Wednesday. I just hate this and really, really hope this time we can figure out what is causing them so I can at least attempt to prevent them.

Hi all! Im relatively new to POTS, although looking back Ive had dysautonomia symptoms for the past 15 years. I started taking a beta blocker about a month ago and have found that it is causing me pretty bad stomach pain, especially after eating. So I guess I have two questions:

1. Anybody have tips to prevent the stomach pain? I also have Type 1 Diabetes, so eating a lot of small meals throughout the day is doable, but not the best option because it makes figuring out insulin doses much harder. 

2. Are beta blockers prescribed primarily because tachycardia is damaging to the body or primarily to treat symptoms caused by tachycardia? If consistent high heart rate is damaging my body, I definitely want to try to stay on a beta blocker. But if its purely for symptom management, I feel like its not worth it for me and I would rather focus on other things to manage my symptoms.

12,rklq1k,t5_2s1h9,"Convulsions due to Wellbrutine?
 

Goodmorning,  since last Thursday I started using Wellbrutine, in an attempt to cure my PSSD (sexual dysfunction, ED, and low libido), sadly I have had this problem since 2018.

I take two pills of 150 mg (300 mg) each morning, but since yesterday I started to have convulsions hours after I took it. The thing is, I had absence epilepsy since I got diagnosed when I was 2, but when I was 10 or 11, it went away thanks to the meds. At least I thought, since epilepsy is in my case genetic, I got it from my mom, who had the convulsion type. So technically it doesn't go away?

Anyway back to my questions, have you guys had a lot of convulsions because of this med? Because yesterday was scary and I even got one in my sleep, I  knew it was coming so I usually either stand up or lay on my side. I  think I was very lucky that I didn't sleep on my stomach, which I  usually do. I think I got it like 4 or 5 times.

42,sx9plv,t5_2s3g1,"Looking for long-term solutions to bloating
I was diagnosed with IBS-D by my gastroenterologist a little over a year ago and was immediately told to begin taking IBgard and Align Probiotics. 

Over the past year, I finally have gotten almost all of my symptoms under control and really dont seem to experience much other than constant bloating and flatulence. I have identified the foods that trigger pain and have been able to add foods back into my diet that previously I could not eat due to my IBS. However, everything I eat makes me feel and look bloated and distended. And then I end up having to pass an ungodly amount of gas.

I am a 22 year old male, I exercise 3-5x per week, I intern at my universitys strength and conditioning facility (so Im always on my feet being active working with the athletes), I pretty much exclusively drink water (besides 1% milk w/breakfast and some juices occasionally), and I eat relatively well. In addition to taking IBgard and Align Probiotics, I also take 1200mg of fish oil and a multivitamin everyday, as well as a Gas-X Xtra Strength after every meal.

This past fall I was prescribed Xifaxin for SIBO and it definitely helped curb the bloating compared to what it was. The NP at the gastro told me to wait a few months before doing a 2nd round, and I requested a refill a few weeks ago. The PA approval expired so I just am waiting for that to go through again. Im hoping that helps relieve the bloating some more, but Im not too confident in the long-term ability of it. 

After the 2nd round of Xifaxin, Im going to make another appointment with my gastro depending on how that goes to see if theres anything else to try.

M, 43. My stomach has been a perennial issue since my teens, when I was diagnosed with IBS. Currently it's constipation--probably owing to not enough exercise or vegetables--and thin stools. The stool shape has been an issue for 12+ years, so it's not new, but within the past 18 months or so I've lost about 20 pounds (170 to 150) without trying. Actually came as a surprise when I went in for a physical since I hadn't been weighing myself during the pandemic.

Gastro I saw wasn't concerned about the weight loss or constipation (said bloodwork was normal) and was about to send me on my way when I mentioned the thin stool. Not sure if he felt like I was just fishing for a colonoscopy, but he finally said, ""OK, let's schedule."" 

Here's the problem: While I have health anxiety and fear colon cancer, I have an equal or bigger fear of the procedure: the sedation, the scope, etc. It's not ""normal"" fear but crippling-type fear that makes me break out in a sweat. I had some rectal bleeding over a decade ago and scheduled/cancelled the procedure even after doing the prep. So, it's bad.

While I see if I can try a new anxiety med: Is there any alternative to this? Cologuard? (Their site says I'm too young but maybe the doc could prescribe.) Barium enema?

New member, Looking for some advice here.  (Sorry for the long post, half of it is me trying to comfort myself). 

I am 42 yr old healthy male. I used to workout 4 times a week weight lifting and cardio, seriously eating healthy and my weight is in the right bmi. 

Few months ago did a full health test. My hba1c, blood pressure, cholesterol heart everything came normal, but uric acid, blood urea etc came high. Uric acid was close to 7. I was on a keto diet at time and peeing a lot so doc told it could be dehydration. Egfr was 67. So a month later I did another test and egfr was in the 80s. But they didnt do the uric acid. Anyways doc told nothing to worry. 


Fast forward two weeks ago, everyone at home got covid, starting with kids. I also got it but it was pretty mild - with just a dry cough and loss of smell.  10 days post symptoms, on the 11th day I was sleeping in the couch. Woke up after an hour and I had a small pain in my right ankle like a sprain. It pains when I twist my ankle. I thought I sprained my leg whilst in the sleep. Next day there was some swelling around the ankle - walking was a bit painful like I was limping. The day after I had some strong pain - then I took an ibuprofen and the pain became less also the swelling got better as well, but still when I twist the ankle it pains and whilst walking. So I called nhs and my  gp rang back. She told me that some people get joint pain after covid and she also told me could it be gout? Then I told her about the uric acid and she asked me to come in after a week for a full kidney test. I also have foamy urine occasionally, when I dont drink enough water.

Gp told me to keep taking ibuprofen and rest. Yesterday worked in the bed, didnt walk around much. Today 3rd day, I woke up and the pain has subsided significantly, I mean whilst twisting the ankle. All this time I was able to walk but limping and there was no pain when I give weight on the leg. Also I heard alcohol and red meat makes gout worse, so last night I ate some pork sausages and had two 50 ml cognac to see if its flares up, but it didnt. 


Ive been reading a lot about gout and the symptoms are confusing. What makes me even pissed is me eating very healthy and working out regularly maintaining healthy weight - I feel so sad. Everything was for nothing !

Hey guys. Almost 2 months ago I got a (at the time only suspected) flare. Never knew what gout was until I did some research after that happened. Then I knew. Bed sheets hurt my swollen big toe.

After 5 weeks I finally went to an urgent care. They wouldnt do a blood test. X-ray was fine. She said she didnt think it was gout because the flare lasted too long. She gave me some prednisone and an Rx NSAID. It kind of helped. But not a ton. Finally went to a podiatrist on Friday (7 weeks after beginning of flare).

I was diagnosed with JME back in April by an FNP and after multiple EEGs, Keppra, Zonisamide, and other meds at increasing doses, I was finally able to to get an appointment with a second neurologist.

At first, the Kepprage was a problem, and then when I switched to the Trileptal, no one told me it would have a problem with the low sodium diet I had been living for the last 10 years.

Now, second neuro is weaning me off meds, saying he does not think I actually HAVE epilepsy and the ""seizures"" I have been having are caused by the meds. He is scheduling more tests and getting me off meds. Thinks my brain is just abnormal and always has been. It is just possible she has me on too many drugs. She has me on 300 mg Zonsimide in am and pm 200 mg Trileptal in am and pm which to me seems like alot. Maybe I just need less.

Sorry for the rather dramatic title but it's a conversation i've been having with myself for a good few months now.

Sorry if this gets long but i guess covering the last couple months is the easiest way to make sense :)

So was diagnosed with epilepsy about 4 and half years ago, i took it pretty well (i was diasgnosed with crohns disease when i was 13 and i took that better than my mother did, kinda just got on with it and have been that way to now) i'm 37 by the way, anyway....as i was saying

When i was diasgnosed with epilepsy after having a couple of tonic clonic seizures in front of friends and family, i took it as i say pretty well, started taking the drugs as im used to with other ailments, realised after a while the side effects of them, wasn't too keen but managed but when i started having arguments with my father at work (family business) i was getting pretty useless at remembering things and being a bit away with the fairies, he was blaming it on me smoking cannabis but it was the meds, then i realised that my friends mother who also had epilepsy was on less meds than me and the poor woman was away with it most the time i chose it was time to reduce my meds, spoke to my doctor and we argreed to change the meds and this helped for a while until i started having seizures more often again i had to up them again which got me back on track without to much ""brain fog"" lets call it.

When i had seizure's i would get over them quite quick but i had one a few months ago which hit me quite bad, not just physically but also mentally, i really felt ""not me"" for a good few weeks and it depressed me a lot, i did get over it after a while but always had it in the back of my mind about how this is what i have to deal with for the rest of life.

Then about a month ago i had a really bad seizure at my work in front of my father and co-worker, i for want of a better phrase, faceplanted a worktop and also crack my bum bone when i hit the deck, as you guessed this one really fucked me up, i've always been known as the guy who just gets on with it and i do most the time but this last couple of weeks i've started to have the thought in my head that i just cannot be fucked with this, and too make things even better i started taking fycompa, which has turned me into the most short fused man you ever did meet.

Also my memory is terrible, so terrible in fact i almost forgot to mention until the end of this spiel, again sorry if it not much sense but just wanted to get it off my chest.

64,ooccnz,t5_2r876,"Just started Kaftrio, it works!
Hello everyone, European guy here, 34 years old, with CF. Im dF508 homozygote, a classic. Im super happy to be able to discuss with other people gravitating around CF to exchange experiences and hopefully good vibes. 

Despite the classic CF genotype, the phenotype could be worse but still affecting my life:

- height > 180 cm
- weight > 74 kg
- on Creon 25000
- no chronic pseudomonas
- bilateral absence of vas deferens 
- no CFRD 
- some clubbing 
- on Usodehoxycholic acid 
- nasal polyps 

For some reason I have most of the symptoms but the lung function has always been good, despite the double dF508. I have never needed hospitalisation or even heavy antibiotics. My FEV has never been below 95% and I do very very little physio (like once a week, and only since 2 years, effectively).

Anyone else with a similar atypical lung condition and the same genotype? Whats your experience?

In the very last years I have had some intermittent pseudomonas (on average  once every 1.5 years) that seems to always go away with Colifin, I have already done 4 successful eradications and I am going through the fifth one that is already showing good results (zero pseudomonas antibodies after 2 months of Colifin), with no effect on the FEV that remains always above 95%.

To make sure that my conditions will remain good, and to try to avoid a chronic pseudomonas infection, I have started Kaftrio, even if that wasnt needed immediately. 

I have to say its impressive: my throat is not dry anymore, I am not coughing at all during the day. Hopefully pseudomonas will not become chronic. 

I had some side effects mostly in terms of bowel troubles but nothing too noticeable. The benefits are way more. Also some bad feeling for costing so much to the insurance fund as we get Kaftrio for free here!

I cant stop repeating myself that Im living a milestone in the medical research and Im lucky enough to be able to benefit from it. 

A warm virtual hug to all those who are still suffering: stay strong and dont give up. We are not far from a solution for everyone with CF.

Also a thought for those who did not make it: if we are living this dream is also because of all those people who were not lucky enough to reach this point.",claim_per_exp,"In the very last years I have had some intermittent pseudomonas (on average  once every 1.5 years) that seems to always go away with Colifin, I have already done 4 successful eradications and I am going through the fifth one that is already showing good results (zero pseudomonas antibodies after 2 months of Colifin), with no effect on the FEV that remains always above 95%.

I'm traveling this week with my fiancé to see his family in Nashville. I made the mistake of not picking up my medication before I left, as I didn't have the time. I figured I'd easily be able to transfer the prescription, which I tried 3 times on the CVS app.

However, since my medication (vimpat) is considered a controlled substance it has been the biggest pain in the ass.

When we flew in on Saturday, I was feeling a bit off. I only took 1 of my vimpat pills in the morning when I should have taken two. I had a lack of sleep, and then had a seizure after we arrived.

The online transfer through CVS' app did absolutely nothing. I called CVS 3-4 times with no luck. Then called my neurologist, but it was a Sunday so only spoke to a nurse. I called back today right when they opened at 8 and was able to get more help, they said they would send the prescription over.

 At noon I went  to the pharmacy, and apparently they  had no record of the request...I called my neurologist's office twice more and they saw the prescription was sent over to the pharmacy I had requested. So they were going to double check with the pharmacy, but assured me it would be there soon.

I haven't gone back to or called the CVS yet, but I have zero optimisim. So, I'm fully expecting to have more seizures tonight or tomorrow....maybe even status epilepticus, which I've had twice before. 

Honestly just ready to give up. Let this shit just take my life so I can be done forever. Almost 10 years with Epilepsy and I don't want to do it anymore.  It hasn't gotten any better over the years, definitely worse; medication resistance, breakthrough seizures, status epilepticus.

I'm scheduled for an MRI next month, to investigate some symptoms that have been ongoing for about a month.

I've also had some vision blurring, that frustrating feeling of having a word stuck right there on the tip of your tongue, and a few - fleeting - moments of disorientation that resulted in missteps. The radiologist will be on hand during the MRI. My doctor has, kindly, shared his suspicions with me, and scheduled bloodwork in addition to the MRI with a referral to a Neurologist.

Obviously, I've fallen down the google/reddit rabbit hole. My biggest fear is that I'm going to have to wait for some time to pass, so they can do another MRI for comparison. Has anyone been able to get a definitive answer after a single MRI? I've done searches here, and see responses on both ends. How did everyone deal with the 'in-between' period?

93,spw3lo,t5_2s3g1,"A bland diet might actually be worth it
Over the holidays (and my birthday) I developed gastritis and went on a completely clear liquid diet for two weeks while I waited for a diagnosis. I lost over 15 lbs in those 2 weeks from barely eating anything
Since my endoscopy and meds, Ive weaned myself back onto solids with a relatively bland diet. Lots of oatmeal, mashed bananas, apples, lean meats, and veggies. Also trying to eat more regularly and focusing on getting enough calories to get me out of starvation mode. 

Unfortunately, the bland diet has made me feel the best Ive felt in a long time. Barely any stomach aches, some bloating, but also regularly bowel movements. 

Its exhausting trying to come up with ideas and meal prepping throughout the week, so Ive been focusing on large breakfasts to get me through the day (aka lots of oatmeal) 

Not eating flavorful or spicy foods has been a little depressing, but if I focus on food as fuel and not fun I do a little better. 

I fucked up today because my office bought pizza and I decided fuck it its my Friday night Ill see if it bothers my stomach. An hour later Im going in and out of the bathroom. 

So after a month of feeling pretty good eating boring, two pieces of bad pizza messed it all up and Im in pain again.

I need some help figuring out where to go next with GERD.

My doctor said I had GERD after having a couple of endoscopies and 24 hour pH monitoring (this actually came back normal whereas the camera showed bad burning)

My acid is bad when I abuse food and drink coffee and beer etc.

It is the hernia feeling I really struggle with. Its affects my breathing badly and PPIs don't help subside it (but it does help with acid). I have tried ezomeprosole, ranitidine and lanzoprozole (spelling from memory there, they may be called different things)

The hernia feeling is constant all day every day. It is awful after I eat eg I ate grapes and drank water yesterday and it was terrible. I ate porridge with blueberries this morning and I was crippled. No acid in the throat but I do cough with it.

Doctors aren't interested in helping the herniated feeling. They simply refer me to diet and PPIs. I eat healthy and take PPIs but I get no joy.

To give context, this only came about after a short illness of flu which I was severely coughing to the point of being sick. A week after I recovered I noticed I could barely breath and the massive pressure in my chest.

I've been tested for h plyori and had ultrasounds of organs which showed nothing.

My question would be, does this sound like something that could be resolved with hiatus hernia surgery? I feel like I am out of options and the doctors refuse to consider this option (I'm in the UK and get the impression they don't do this surgery unless it's life and death)

I can't even function normally, as I have to skip most of my classes due to my stomach rumbling loudly and having to take ghost shits.

First, your community here is awesome. Thanks for letting me lurk here for a while. I am a General Surgeon but I know so little about the advances in respiratory medicine that it has been very insightful to hear from you all as patients who (have to be) so informed on the disease.
A little about me- I am in my 30s, have had a diagnosis of asthma and allergies since I was a teen, on multiple variations of inhalers and allergy shots over the years. Since high school I have had pneumonia multiple times, twice they did sputum and it was pseudomonas both times. I have a chronic productive cough that is my norm but at times its bad enough my coworkers can tell when Im really sick better than I can. I had a CT 10 years ago or so that showed bronchiectasis and my allergist wanted to test me for CF then, but we never got around to it and I moved around a lot for school. 10 yrs later, my symptoms have progressively gotten worse, and my coworkers suggested I see a Pulmonologist. 
Confirmed pseudomonas again. Follow up CT this year shows way worse bronchiectasis, bronchoceles and some opacities from the resolving pneumonia. 
I had done 23&me and found out Im a carrier for CF. One parent is, and one was negative. But knowing they dont test for all mutations I am starting to wonder is this CF-carrier related symptoms (have read journal articles that carriers can have milder forms), or should I get tested for the other less common mutations? My pulmonologist says we dont have that capability in our town and doesnt seem that concerned thats its CF. All my IgG subclasses, IgE etc came back normal.
I always thought if it really was CF I would be a lot more sick. But after being on an extended dose of Levaquin and finally *not* having a nasty productive cough like I usually do, I am realizing I didnt know how chronically sick I really was. I *ran* for the first time in years recently. It burned, but I did it, and I want to be able to continue. 
Sorry for the long post. Just want to say you all are awesome, keep on keeping on, and thanks for listening.
Also if anyone has great tips for postural drainage and expectoration I would love to hear them!

EDIT 12/21 to say I have my sweat test tomorrow AM. They also tested for alpha-1 antitrypsin today. And we found out they *do* test at our facility its just a send out lab test so thats cool. Will update you all with the result when I get it! Thank you everyone for pushing me to get the sweat test. No matter what the result I will rest easier having AN answer.

EDIT 1/5/22: I got a phone call today that my sweat test was negative. They are sending me on to ENT for a nasal biopsy to look for PCD. I dont have the actual value of the sweat chloride test as it hasnt uploaded to my patient portal yet. If its borderline, I could consider retesting, but for now this feels like progress/reassurance. Still waiting on the A1AT result. Kind of anxious though that I am diving down an expensive rabbit hole that might all come up negative but if thats the case I suppose thats good, and I will hopefully have learned how to better care for the bronchiectasis anyway. Having an etiology would be nice but at the end of the day many treatments seem to be the same/similar. I am using the flutter valve more diligently and exercising on a schedule now. Autogenic drainage hasnt been too fruitful but Ill keep trying at it. Trying to stay very hydrated though its hard with my job. Pulm mentioned maybe getting me a vest, too.

119,p47si6,t5_2syer,"Should I continue with Intermittent Fasting?
Hi everyone,

28(M) here and I'm curious if Intermittent Fasting actually does affect your Uric Acid levels. I had to recently control my Uric Acid as it was initially 9.2mg/dL and after a month of correcting my diet with intermittent fasting and taking 100mg Allopurinol it is now 7.3 mg/dL. I also had to heavily limit my spicy food since I read it directly affects Uric Acid.

My doctor set me on a goal to have it go down to 6mg/dL and I'm worried with his advice that Intermittent Fasting can cause Uric Acid levels to go up and they expected my Uric Acid to drop down to 6mg/dL in a month. I'm starting to suspect that Intermittent Fasting contributed to me not reaching that goal.

Should I keep up with the Intermittent Fasting despite not meeting my goal for the month?

Also a few things about my diet:
I skip breakfast as part of my 16:8 fasting period. Personal preference because eating in the morning makes me feel sick. I barely eat any red meat. I've been eating more of Fish and Chicken alongside vegetables and fruits. Also for my grains its a mix of Brown and Red Rice.",claim_per_exp,I also had to heavily limit my spicy food since I read it directly affects Uric Acid,338,422,84,(S (NP (PRP I)) (ADVP (RB also)) (VP (VBD had) (S (VP (TO to) (ADVP (RB heavily)) (VP (VB limit) (NP (PRP$ my) (JJ spicy) (NN food)) (SBAR (IN since) (S (NP (PRP I)) (VP (VBP read) (SBAR (S (NP (PRP it)) (ADVP (RB directly)) (VP (VBZ affects) (NP (NNP Uric) (NNP Acid))))))))))))),S,1
120,s4xqhs,t5_2s23e,"Tell me about your optic neuritis recovery
Last week of November and I had a pretty good onset of ON in my right eye. Id never had this before and didnt know what was going on. My eye basically completely fogged over with a grey fog that made it look like I was looking through very heavily frosted glass. I could not really see any light at all. I could look at a house of Christmas lights, close my good eye, and see nothing. I could see a bit peripherally and some shadows. 

A few days later after an emergency visit to an ophthalmologist, I did a three day course of methylprednisilone, I ended that about 6.5 weeks ago.

I would say within 10-14 days my eye got quite a bit better, however the difference between a month ago and now is far less, recovery seems to be much slower now, I have read thats pretty normal. I would say now my eye is 80% when I am just sitting around, but it drops to more like 50-60% when I am active, or after a shower. 

So I guess what I am asking is Do I still have hope this is going to continue to improve? I understand this could take many months to heal, which Im ok with, it just seems that with the small amount of progress in the past four weeks or so, if it is going to get better its going to take a heck of a long time.

Honestly the most annoying part is not even the vision, its that it feels like Im wearing a dry contact lens all the time. Anyone who wears contacts will know what I mean. If it felt normal I wouldnt really care as much.  Sometimes that feeling is right in the middle of my eye, and sometimes its at the top and sometimes the outer edge. It seems to me some movement like that is probably a positive sign, but I dont really know. 

So How bad did your vision initially get?

Did it recover fully?

How long did it take?

Hey there! I'll try to make it short. 

I got diagnosed with IBS-D in the beginning of 2021. I got medication and it got a little better but I still had a few days of diarrhea per week. 

In january I quit gluten containing grains completely (even though I got tested negative on celiac) and my IBS got better. I was constipated a lot sadly, but at least I had no diarrhea at all for the whole month which never happened before. 

In the beginning of February I decided to reintroduce gluten into my diet to see if it makes a difference. At first it seemed that I could digest it properly. It took around 8 days for my usual digestive problems (diarrhea and bloating) to slowly start again and get worse over time. Now, one more week later (so 2 weeks after starting gluten again), I have daily diarrhea again after pretty much every meal. 

Is it possible that I only react to gluten if I have it in my diet long term and that is why I didn't have a reaction for the first 8 days after introducing it back into my diet?

122,qk6rgw,t5_2rtve,"Plaquenil and hypopigmentation
I have been taking 200mg/day of plaquenil for the last  year and a half for mild lupus. Plaquenil has stabilized my blood work and I have done well on it. However, I've noticed over the past month the loss of pigmentation (hypopigmentation) on the lateral portions of my lower legs and forearms - these are areas that have tanned over the years due to sun exposure but the darker pigment has given way to lighter patches (circles and ovals).  As of now, it seems confined to areas of my body that have had sun exposure. It almost looks like vitiligo or guttate hypomelanosis, but the white patches are larger in diameter than what is typically seen in guttate hypomelanosis. The package insert for HCQ says that ""pigmentation disorders"" may occur with plaquenil - thus the reason I suspect that plaquenil is playing a role here. One possible complication is that I'm a 67-year-old male so perhaps some of the pigmentation loss is age related -- but it seemingly has come on fairly quickly.

Last week I had my 4th Tysabri infusion - over the last 2 or 3 infusions, Ive noticed that about a week after the infusion I go through a week of high levels of depression mixed with anxiety, anxiousness, the whole thing. Or even got bad enough I took today off of work to just have a me day. Which isnt a bad thing imo. I have dealt with some anxiety and depression in general pre MS diagnosis and I know MS as it progresses can make it worse.

136,st79ri,t5_2s3g1,"How can I not give up?
Hey people. Since 5th grade (when school turned to morning shift) my guts became dysfunctional. I live with constant bloating and have incomplete bowel movements. Gladly I rarely feel any pain, which is very common among ibs sufferers, so I'm not even sure my problem can be considered exactly ibs. 

Despite that, my life has been completely ruined by it. I can't stick to a normal routine, missed a lot of classes in school and college, can't travel with friends, can't have relationships etc. Basically, I can't spend more than a ""shift"" outside home without being bothered by constant bloating and frequent bathroom visits. 

This problem aggravated my long-lasting depression of almost a decade. Most medicines don't work very well because they usually worsen constipation symptons. Too much fiber worsen bloating. It seems ALL foods have some triggering action, but yes, I do know some that are worse and try to avoid it. The last thing I tried are multi-enzyme pills (Enzymedica), but they don't seem to help much. Domperidone seems to help and I advise you to try it if you have similar symptons. Simethicone is only palliative and doesn't help much.

Anyway, I know that I will have problems in the future when I somehow become employed. But that's the future, I can't even live a normal life now in a flexible schedule (college classes are all spread out and because of covid it's all online now, which also doesn't help, as I have absolutely no motivation to study anymore).

The thing is, maybe I'd be depressed without IBS, maybe I'd have the same ""functional"" problems, but IBS definitely made it all worse and more difficult to deal with. How can I feel motivated to study to become eventualy employed if I know for a fact that I can't stick to a ""normal"" routine? How can I fix my waking up time if I will spend hours in bathroom in the mornings or at least releasing gas all the time?

Everyday I feel like giving up, I don't know what's the point of enduring suffering if prospects are of just more suffering. Thoughts? I'd appreciate, thanks.

139,sts1hc,t5_2s3g1,"Recovery update.
Hi all. My IBS started exactly around one year ago after being prescribed a cocktail of antibiotics for a uti (which I didnt really need). The medication that did me in was ciprofloxacin. 
Following that medication; my gut health had been the worst it had EVER been. I had every GI symptom imaginable. My initial symptoms were malabsorption and diarrhea for around 2 months straight.
After around 2 months, I started to bloat a lot and I had horrible gas and burping for another few months coupled with extreme pain in my colon. Then following this; I would wake up with intense nausea and intestinal burning every single day. I also had extreme histamine reactions to all sorts of foods. My skin was also covered in acne. I was later diagnosed with gastritis (had ulcers everywhere) but was h pylori negative. I also had a host of other symptoms that I feel dissociated from now. 

Today - I am around 98% recovered from this IBS flare. I wouldnt say 100% since I still flare up from some processed food and dairy. I can pretty much eat everything else now though. I am definitely headed in the right path and aim to see 100% recovery within the next 2 weeks. 

What I did:

Honestly initially I felt sooooooooooooo hopeless. I was doing EVERYTHING right yet nothing was working. Name a common gut health strategy and you bet I did it.

I started off with a simple drug store probiotic thinking thats all I need to heal. It did nothing. I then tried l glutamine, slippery elm, marshmallow root. Although these things did soothe my gut; I still had a plethora of symptoms like bloody stools, nausea, extreme bloating and gut pains and also early satiety. I felt like pulling my hair out because conventional gut healing protocols just werent working. I would cry every single day because I felt like this is my reality now. I then stumbled upon the 4Rs technique and I started with eliminating all fodmaps, gluten, dairy, processed food for 4 weeks and a course of herbals to clean the system out. I proceeded with using gut soothers such as cabbage juice, glutamine powder, slippery elm, marshmallow root tea, I would also drink turmeric in tea, camomile and peppermint teas, hot water with fenugreek seeds and fennel seeds, hot water with lemon and apple cider vinegar shot. I also kept my diet super super clean with lots of steamed fish and non starchy veg. I then started adding in probiotics, digestive enzymes, betaine hcl, digestive bitters, apple cider vinegar before all meals, hot water and lemon and ginger teas sipped  throughout the day. Finally I started adding in fodmaps again, more probiotics and fermented fooods + lots of fibre especially in the form of berry smoothies with lots of greens and seeds. Despite doing all of this, my gut health was still awful and I kept spiralling down into a deep depression thinking this is my reality now.

142,rmrj90,t5_2qlaa,"Gerd! Barretts esophagus? And other 'symptoms'.
First post to reddit ever (repost so technically second), please excuse any faux pas. I'm hoping for input from anybody with relevant experience or insight from the gastroenterological community. I live in a reasonably poor community where medical treatment is stingy and average by western standards at best. I have had bloating, reflux, chest pain (as a result of bloating) etc for over 2 years, Approximately 4 months ago I started to develop some more unusual symptoms which have seemed to progress. Particularly i have experienced sudden faintness,sweating, intense facial flushing, muscle weakness in arms and legs, cotton mouth, light headedness, and mental fogging (trouble concentrating and formulating sentences) these symptoms tend to cluster together and jointly last for approximately 1-4 hours. I saw a good gp and finally got prescribed omeprazole (ppi) and found it instantly life changing, bloating gone,  pain gone, pure relief, no weird symptoms for 3 weeks. Then a few days later, the most severe cluster of symptoms so far. I had to leave a shop, return to the car where I sat for 2 hours, couldn't Remember the drive to where I was headed, went to bed and my head was spinning as if I had drunk a dozen, and awoke with a sort of hangover from the experience, the next evening my stomach was on fire. It may be relevant that I bungled my ppi dose by accidentally taking a second dose a few days before. I saw a doctor, agreed I probably have gerd and perhaps even barretts esophagus but the remainder of the symptoms the gp believed were psychological (suggestion of panic attacks...) they would like to wait a month until I finish my script of omeprazole and then we'll 'look at an endoscopy'. My concern naturally is that, there is an underlying gastroenterological cause for these more unusual symptoms rather than a psychological one, and that these more extreme symptoms seem to be progressing. I am unable to get a referral to a specialist locally as there are no specialists in the district or region especially amidst christmas.

145,s6coca,t5_2tyg2,"Citalopram (antidepressant) gave me a psychotic episode.
TRIGGER WARNING delusions and hallucinations. 

I had a weird reaction to citalopram (an antidepressant) and I dont think this is spoken about much, so I wanted to post it on here.

I was put on the LOWEST dose of citalopram after complaining about my depression and anxiety to the doctor. This experience happened with my FIRST time taking the citalopram pill (yes- first time and the lowest dose!) and it was really bizarre. 

MY EXPERIENCE:
I took the medication earlier in the day- I cant remember what time but it was between 11am and 1pm. I felt completely fine all day, then by about 9pm I started feeling really weird. I thought people were in my house watching me, so I decided to go up to bed thinking perhaps I was just tired and my body was trying to adapt to this new medication. I lived with my mom at the time, so I went to say goodnight to her and then I saw her face morphing before my eyes. Her face was morphing to look like different peoples faces- perhaps a new face every 2 seconds. I screamed at her STOP DOING THAT WITH YOUR FACE!! I thought it was entirely real at the time!! She said doing what and I burst into tears, telling her she knows what shes doing. I ran to my room and lay down, trying to console myself and get my head around wtf was going on. Then, I got this weird belief that the devil was in my room. I couldnt turn the light off or put my phone down, or else the devil would grab me- he could only grab me if I was unaware and could not see him. Eventually, I fell asleep with the light on whilst crying. 

Ive hallucinated in the past, but usually just VERY minor hallucinations. This experience was SO odd. Im fine now.

Hi,

I am having bad reaction on Plegridy (red big patches that itch long after injection was administered). It has been few months and it hasn't gotten better. I didn't have this on Betaseron, and since both are interferon I compared the additives in these injection to find the culprit.

What **Plegridy** injections have extra apart from **Betaferon (Betaseron)**  is

*L-*[*arginine*](https://www.rxlist.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=7006) *HCl* 

[*sodium acetate*](https://www.rxlist.com/sodium-acetate-drug.htm) *trihydrate*

*glacial* [*acetic acid*](https://www.rxlist.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=32085) \- this I found is strong skin and mucus membrane irritant

*polysorbate 20* \- possible allergen

**And Kesimpta has**

 *e L-arginine*

 *sodium acetate trihydrate*

*polysorbate 80* \- possible alergen

*disodium edetate dihydrate*

 *hydrochloric acid* 

So, I am hoping that the problematic ingredients giving me itchy red patches that don't fade is the glacial acetic acid which is NOT in Kesimpta. But it could also be the polysorbate, which is in both. By my own deduction, the irritating ingredient is the one which purpose it is to make the drug release gradually. Because it gets worse after 7-10th day after injection.

I am afradit I will fight for this drug and end up with the same reactions. My doctor told me I am THE ONLY ONE of his patients having local site reactions to Plegridy. Which is strange, because he said he has many patients on Plegridy and I found that according to leaflet 66% of patients have it. And only around 11% have local site reactions to Kesimpta, which is hopeful to me

I will appreciate any thoughts - reassurance from those who don't local site reaction, or replies from those who do have, or any experience going from interferon to Kesimpta.

My doctor is not of much help with this, they just suggested K-vitamin cream, which does nothing, because my skin is irritated and not bruised. They see a bruise and think it is a bruise. What helps a little bit are antihistamine cream and pills, but I don't want to take the pill every day and it doesn't help that much.

149,ssdc9m,t5_2s3g1,"Any and all suggestions welcome! Constant abdominal distension
Hi all,

Im a 31 year old woman and Ive had constipation for roughly 15 years - I cant recall an exact time or event that brought it on. 

I used to always use miralx but got off it as I lived in countries where it wasnt available. Im now back on it and using fybogel for the last month or so. 

My main issue is that my abdomen is always distended. It is better in the morning, gets worse throughout the day, and is very visibly much more distended at the end of the day. This is every single day. I used to notice the bloating would improve if I had full bowl movements, but that doesnt seem to the case anymore.  

The GI thinks its possible I have IBS, but I dont have any pain. I get stomach pain maybe once a month, if even that. Its just the distension and feeling bloated at the end of the day. As most of you have said here, its extremely disheartening and frustrating. Im pretty fit but dont look it in the evening and definitely dont feel it. 

I am now in my fourth week of the low FODMAP elimination and have had zero improvement in the distension. Im essentially living off chicken/fish and rice and am quickly losing the will to continue the diet. I feel like I cannot eat anything (and I love food) and am seeing no improvement so wondering what is the point? Im still distended badly every evening.

SIBO breath test was negative. Pelvic ultrasound was normal. The nurse said so much gas while doing it. Id just started the fybogel a few days before this so I dont know if the excess gas is my normal state or it was due to starting the fybogel. Stool sample was normal as well.

I work out regularly (weight lifting mostly, cardio, yoga and lots of walks). Ive tried store bought probiotics ages ago and didnt notice any difference. I dont have celiacs. I dont normally eat a lot of dairy, but I havent had any since being on the low fodmap diet (except some low lactose cheeses). I feel very lucky that I dont have debilitating pain or anything but feel pretty bad about myself and my appearance every night. Okay 

Basically Im looking for any suggestions on what else to say to my doctor or what else it could be. Is it possible the distention is just from the constipation and will go away once Im having more regular bowl movements??",claim_per_exp,"The GI thinks its possible I have IBS, but I dont have any pain.

Just a small question/rant. About a year ago I had a colonoscopy that diagnosed me with IBS.

Has anyone else had a polyp this large at such a young age? It seems crazy that this is possible in a mostly healthy person.

I have a doctors appointment on Friday. I have been diagnosed for 7 years. Wow that shocks me. I have been and am stil on a beta blocker (atenolol) twice a day, and still struggling. I just learned that apparently there are other medication options for those with POTS besides just salt and a beta blocker. I think the beta blocker also may make some aspects worse. But I do need it for a high heart rate. I think it is time to change up my medications. I want to have a well informed conversation with my doctor.

I know we are not supposed to look for diagnoses and that is not what Im doing, Im just trying to see if anyone elses  experience is similar to mine so that I feel more confident about this being what I have. 

Ever since November 24, 2021 I have been dealing with the following issues:

-Headache
-Ears popping and cracking
-Throat feels tight
-Shortness of breath, feels like throat full and something pulling back against breaths
-Feels like hand around throat
-Burning where throat meets ears, where throat meets nose
-Feels like something in throat
-Feels like inserts on L and R side of throat
-Sometimes feels like mucus in throat, clears throat and just ton of saliva 
-Intermittent shortness of breath temporarily relieved with belching
-Excess belching, sometimes with whole throat closing after
-Some belching does not feel like it come from esophagus but from around (makes no sense, but thats what it feels like) 
-Frequent hiccuping
-Intermittent nausea 
-Bend neck down feels something sharp middle right side
-Lost 10 lbs without trying 

When I wake up Im okay, but within an hour I have all my symptoms again. Eating also makes everything worse and I have switched to very small FODMAP meals that I chew until they are liquid.

I have been on Pepcid, Omeprazole, and a ton of other meds and antibiotics thinking it might be a virus or infection. Nothing seemed to work. I went to an ENT and they did the small scope that goes down your nose. They said I do not have any physical abnormalities, but they said I have Paradoxical Vocal Cord Dysfunction. I might have that, but it still doesnt explain the rest of the symptoms bedsides the pain and shortness of breath. I see a GI in the next month, but I am miserable being short of breath every day 24/7. The feeling is so unsettling that I cannot sleep until 4am when Im so tired I cannot keep my eyes open.

im 18 and female

for the last month and a half, ive been experiencing intense nausea flares and almost constant mild nausea, unusual bowel movements, muscle spasms (dont know if thats the correct word), dizziness, headaches, heart attack-like symptoms whilst exercising, brain fog, worsened insomnia, and fatigue. 

id been experiencing milder versions of these symptoms (like always getting nauseous after meals and heart pains/extremely fast heartrate during exercise ect) for about a year or two until i had what seemed to be a typical stomach virus in early january, and i havent had a normal day since

i didnt know what PoTS was until quite recently, and after i read the symptoms and realized that i experience almost every symptom daily, i immediately did a poor mans tilt test. my results where 91bpm after 10 mins laying down, 157bpm after 10 minutes standing up, then 104 within 2 minutes of sitting again. i did it again faster and my results where 89 (sitting) 139 (within one minute of standing) 84 (sitting again).

i told my doctor this and they told me it was just anxiety, refused to test me, and prescribed me diazapam which did not eliviate my symptoms (i am diagnosed with BPD, GAD and ASD so i do get frequent anxiety, but its NEVER caused these symptoms before) they also ruled out anemia because my bloods came back normal

the only things so far that ive found help eliviate my symptoms are salty foods, sitting/laying down, being in rooms slightly below normal temperature and drinking cold water or ginger/peppermint tea

im not self diagnosing, and im not posting this in hopes of anyone here diagnosing me, ive just been uncomfortable and in pain for a while and this past month has been the last straw thats made me desperate for answers. im so tired.

Hi everyone.  I apologize in advance because this is a bit of a rant/ I also have a question.

My name is Bianca and I've had epilepsy since I was 10.  I'm turning 30 on Thursday.  (I'm really depressed about it but that's another story.)
 
Background info on meds I've been on since I was diagnosed:
1.  Valproic Acid - Stopped that pretty quick because I had visual and auditory hallucinations, hair loss and brutal stomach aches
2.  Keppra -  I got up to 750mg twice a day
3.  Lamotragine - Currently at 50 mg twice a day.  I did take up to 200mg total but my personality changed so I got back down to 50 mg.

So I've struggled with what I'm convinced are some type of partial seizure.  I call them ""auras"".  I get the tingling in my hands and feet, I feel kind of disassociated but still aware of surroundings, I'm still able to communicate, and i do have muscle jerks.  Along with it, I also get a headache and my pupils double in size.  In high school it was really embarrassing because I had 2 breakthrough seizures while at school and when these auras kicked in, the ambulance was called a few times because to the principal and secretaries I went pale as a ghost and was too drained to respond, along with my other symptoms.  They last for hours, until I sleep it off.  If I can sleep.  I've complained about it since I got diagnosed.  My pediatric neuro had no idea what to do so when I was old enough I was sent to an adult one at a very good hospital for it in Toronto.  I stuck with this guy until recently.  As highly regarded as he was, he didn't really help me.  I've had countless EEGs and they always came out normal.  I never had an aura that was documented.  But with these symptoms, I strongly feel its a type of seizure.  So I asked him to send me for a second opinion.  A YEAR AND A HALF LATER (stupid waitlist) I spoke with another neuro and I explained everything.  The only thing I've observed that makes this auras more likely to happen is lack of sleep.  Thanks to the 2 meds I'm on, it worsened my insomnia (I take THC to sleep but I still sleep shitty), worsened my anxiety and depression.  I tell this new neuro I think it's a type of seizure.  She tells me, ""Well I don't think it is seizures, it could be a learning disability that isn't diagnosed"" I was floored.  So I asked, and what learning disability could cause these symptoms?  She said she didn't know but she did schedule an ambulatory EEG (I'm still waiting for a call 3 months after I spoke to her) and I'm on a waitlist to go have a sleepover at the hospital so I can be monitored.  I told her it's a waste of time because I always come back normal, but there is something wrong.  

The only thing she suggested was to try to get off Keppra and transition to Brivaracetam.  I was and still am terrified.  When I last had a grand mal, I was 17.  I wasn't driving so no real consequences.  But I have a job, I'm married and my husband cannot work from home for a year to drive me to and from work.  But regardless of my severe anxiety, i bit the bullet and agreed to try.  She wanted to do it in 3 weeks, the transition of meds.  I told her no, based on my last gran mal I'm too anxious to do it too quickly, you need to find a way to stretch it out.  She kept trying to push for 3 weeks, I really pushed back and said no.  So I'm already not really happy with this new neuro I waited over a year for.  She found a way to stretch it to 6 weeks.  I'm in week 3 now and it's been hell.

The auras are much more frequent, much more intense and much more exhausting.  I've had to miss work a few days because I felt really out of it.  It's not like I can call my neuro and talk to her directly.  Oh no.  I have to wait at least 2 business days for the secretary to get back to me, then wait weeks for an appointment over the phone.  If I do get an appointment, I have to spend an hour talking to the nurse, then wait half hour, then talk to the dr and nurse together.  I don't like it, but whatever.  My old neuro didn't have this politics.  I'd talk to him directly.  Also, she made a follow up appointment all the way in May.  I would think that after this transition of meds, you'd schedule a follow up to see how I handled it, not 6 months later.  So I left another voicemail stating that i need to talk with her in 3 weeks because I feel its nonsense that I'd have to wait that long.  God forbid what if I have an episode?  I don't talk to her until May?

Anyway.  I'm hoping for that appointment to happen in 3 weeks.


What I will say is that I'm 100% sure I have adult ADHD.  I just don't have 2 grand to spend to get diagnosed.  But I do want to try meds for it.  Luckily at work there is a fellow epileptic and she disregarded what her psychiatrist said and she started adderall and she'd in a much better place.  I'd like to go down that route as well, just so I can see if it makes a difference and I can say I tried.  I also want meds to help with my anxiety and depression.  The next step is anti psychotics (according to my previous psychiatrist) and this neuro doesn't want me on any of them.

My question is, does anyone else identify with these auras I have, does anyone feel that it may be a type of seizure or am I crazy? 

I've never opened up to strangers about my experience because I've carried this childhood shame to talk about it because I was bullied for having it.  But I'm getting really frustrated and with the support of my husband, I'm opening up to this community.  I'd really appreciate any input.

Thank you everyone in advance.

edit: I'm at 250mg of keppra twice a day and 50mg of Briva-whatever twice a day. And I've also had 8 concussion.

I would think that after this transition of meds, you'd schedule a follow up to see how I handled it, not 6 months later.  So I left another voicemail stating that i need to talk with her in 3 weeks because I feel its nonsense that I'd have to wait that long.  God forbid what if I have an episode?  I don't talk to her until May?

Anyway.  I'm hoping for that appointment to happen in 3 weeks.


What I will say is that I'm 100% sure I have adult ADHD.  I just don't have 2 grand to spend to get diagnosed.  But I do want to try meds for it.  Luckily at work there is a fellow epileptic and she disregarded what her psychiatrist said and she started adderall and she'd in a much better place.  I'd like to go down that route as well, just so I can see if it makes a difference and I can say I tried.  I also want meds to help with my anxiety and depression.  The next step is anti psychotics (according to my previous psychiatrist) and this neuro doesn't want me on any of them.

My question is, does anyone else identify with these auras I have, does anyone feel that it may be a type of seizure or am I crazy? 

I've never opened up to strangers about my experience because I've carried this childhood shame to talk about it because I was bullied for having it.  But I'm getting really frustrated and with the support of my husband, I'm opening up to this community.  I'd really appreciate any input.

Thank you everyone in advance.

Long story short I started lexapro because of panic attacks and I think it gave me ptsd from how terrible it was. Ever since then the line between my dreams and reality has been kinda merged. The first night on lexapro I would have weird visions that were between imagining them and actually seeing them, its like it was an acid trip. I was seeing colors and patterns. I also saw a dream of me at work. I didnt sleep that night because I couldnt shut my brain off and it would wake up anytime I almost fell asleep. Anyways, Ive been having this similar issue so it takes me an hour or two of falling asleep, half dreaming and waking up before I actually fall asleep. Lst night, I fell asleep easier but I woke up in the middle of the night and everything was staticy and fuzzy and when I looked at my pillow it had a spiraly rainbow pattern going on that took like two minutes to fade away. I was legit hallucinating and Ive never had anything like this happen before trying the lexapro. Forgot to note- I only lasted 6 days on the lexapro and its been like two weeks since my last dose
Whats going on with me?

I haven't been diagnosed with anything but symptoms is related to gerd/acid reflux and I'm kind of new to all of this gerd stuff. 





Last month, I had the most terrible heartburn (before taking medication) and went to see my GP next day. I told my doctor the problem and the doctor did some quick checkups like blood pressure, oximeter pulse, felt my stomach and liver, listen to my heart beat and said its all good. He then prescribed me lansoprazole 30mg and said to take them for 4 week

I took it on the first day. Nothing special happened and felt the same until on my 5th day, my symptoms gotten better to nothing. Then here is where the mistakes starts to begin. After a few days of dieting from 1-7 days, I started to eat fried food, takeaways, fish and chips, spicy foods, fizzy drinks. Nothing had happened so I thought I was all good. These capsules made hungry a lot so I always have something to eat. Began eating chocolate, crisps, sweets etc. 

I then researched online that I was meant to take it for 2 weeks since its not safe to take long term. Now this is the regret I'm feeling right now. My doctor said to take it for 4 weeks but instead, I only did for 2 weeks just because of anxiety from online. Basically thinking of the worst and negatives on ppi's.

After I stopped on week 2, I just went cold turkey after. Nothing really happened on my first week as I still ate spicy food, takeaways, you name it. Then I started to notice some burning sensation on my chest (mild but it is bothersome) and Then after I completely lost my appetite. 

Now I'm on 2nd week of stopping lansoprazole and I'm still feeling the same like No appetite and burning sensation on the chest. To be honest I don't know if this is acid rebound as somebody said that it feels like ""kicking you in the stomach every 30 seconds"") which I don't feel like that. It's more of a flare up feeling at the moment as it sounds like.

Looking back now, I feel ashamed. I should of done better and researched more. I'm now feeling sad and upset and I don't know if I'm ever gonna be healed. Feeling deepest regrets just writing this post. I should of listened to my doctor and this time I went to take this more seriously.



Coud anybody give me advice in advance. It would be greatly  appreciated. 

Will these symptoms go away?

Should I give it another go? (Think will do it anyways)

Thank you for taking your time reading. 

I will keep updating this post from now on.




Quick Update 24/12/2021: so I went to see my GP and told my mistake. He told me to do a full course this time for 4 week with lansoprazole. He then gave me a stool test for pylori. But since I haven't taken PPI'S for 2 weeks I can do it straight away before I go back to ppi's 

I noticed some symptom I had from 2 days ago. I mentioned that I had no appetite, well it came back yesterday and today aswell. I was so hungry when I was trying to sleep. At the moment, the symptoms I only have is irritation feeling in the chest. It does feeling something wrong tho. It's not painful but bothersome.

I'm hoping to get sorted out soon. I will keep posted from now on. I will let you guys know about the shit test aswell.

Update 1/15/22:

Hello all, so it's been 3 weeks since I'm on ppi's again and I'm feeling OK for starters. The only issue now is throat pain after a little cough. Usually goes away in like 3 seconds but I dont know what it could be but apart from that I'm feeling OK. Doesn't feel burning but more feeling like an ache. I've been eating better than before and drank pretty much just water nearly for a month now. I did a stool test 3 weeks ago and nothing got back to me so hopefully I assume that nothing was there. At the moment I'm tapering and stopping on the 4th week, the hopefully, I can live without them.

So, with lansoprazole, it's been all over the place. When I started I had constant diarrhea for like 4 days. Then after that I had bad constipation. I took a medicine that my dad uses when he has constipation. After that I took like 10ml of it, I had the biggest shit of my life. Big relief after that I think my stomach adjusted itself and now shitting normally I guess?. Anyways, however it messed up my mentality. I feel more tired and waking up the middle of the night. Its Tiring but I'm still fighting. I think that's it really, just affecting my mentality and energy. I think I'm low on b12, magnesium I think but idk. I'm tapering right now so hope for the best I can do this, if not then well, I have to go to the doctors again and request a endoscopy.",claim_per_exp,"I took it on the first day.

195,rl9wsj,t5_2s1h9,"I think I'm having focal aware seizures but I don't feel like I can talk to anyone about it, even my doctors.
The facts:

Last spring I experienced an 'altered state of consciousness' which involved:

*Feeling intense ecstatic joy
*Experiencing full body waves of electricity.
*Losing my sense of self entirely 
*Feeling connected to the universe
*Experiencing strange connections between things that seem unrelated
*Believing I could make the flowers grow with my mind
*Hearing messages in the radio from God
*Experiencing everything as if it were shapes and motions rather than things, e.g. the roundabout as I was driving up to it looked like a washing machine and cars were sloshing about in it rather than just being cars - hard to explain)
*Experiencing time slowing down, as if I could watch everything happen in slow motion.

Various combinations of these symptoms continue to happen from time to time, but not all at once like this. For instance, I might experience the frisson and joy alongside time slowing down, but briefly and not with the whole host of other things that happened in that case. 

Now, what is going on presently:

I began taking ADHD meds (Methylphenidate) about 6 months ago from a low dose to 36mg XR. I have been having the following experiences as well:

*Rising sensations in the stomach accompanied almost always by a visceral sensation of fear. 
*Choking feeling in the throat. 
*Tension headaches. 
* Vertigo.
*Sensation of extreme heat in the body, radiating out. 
*Nausea. 
*Muscle tension - particularly in shoulders, neck and middle back and usually following on from the above feelings. 
*Body tingling all over and at different rates.
*This happens most often either at night during interrupted sleep or during meditation. 

I used to meditate a lot but have recently found that I cannot do this without experiencing these unpleasant results. 

I am at a loss. I feel like a hypochondriac, but I can't work out what is happening to me. I saw my doctor for the headaches and she's done a basic neurological exam twice and is happy that I don't have any tumours or problems elsewise, but I'm going mad not knowing what is happening. 

I feel like I have no choice but to wait for something worse to happen. I'm scared. I don't want this to get worse, but I feel like I'm not being taken seriously. I once opened up to this community before and I was treated with some disdain by commenters who thought that because I was not diagnosed officially that I was trying to make light of their condition, nothing could be further from the truth! I just want to stop something from happening before it does. I don't want to have a fit in public or in front of my family. I don't want to hurt my brain anymore if it is getting damaged by some kind of focal seizure. 

I don't have anyone to talk to. My housemate would laugh in my face and my doctors don't take me seriously. My family embrace all of the mystical experiences that I have, but they don't want to pathologise it. Fine, but a bit naive considering that it could get worse and that they will probably absolve themselves of responsibility when it comes to that. 

I don't know who else to turn to and I can't figure out what is wrong with me. I'm losing my mind and I have to keep it all inside. 

I don't even think I want anyone to agree that something is wrong here, but just seeking some compassion and understanding, which I appreciate is outside of the norm.

Honestly not really one to make these posts. I was on PPIs for about 5 years since I was about 23. I was always extremely healthy but my stomach and throat constantly felt like a volcano.

I went vegan about 5 months ago for a month or two and tried not to eat processed food at all while weaning off PPIs.

218,rsk6vx,t5_2qlaa,"Developing GERD after gallbladder removal?
Hello, everyone. I'm quite new to having GERD, and I guess more than anything I'm looking for others who developed the condition in similar ways to me. 

Long story not exactly short: I've had Celiac disease all my life, found out about it in high school, really didn't take my diet seriously until very recently. I'm pretty sure this is where most of my GI complications come from; even though I'm strict about my diet now, there's two and a half decades worth of damage done to my gut at this point. 

Over the last year, I'd been having odd symptoms that my doctor quite frankly shrugged off. Assumed it was just a weird Celiac thing. In October, things went very downhill very fast, I ended up in the ER, and discovered I needed my gallbladder removed. Had the thing taken out on November 12th, and started developing GERD symptoms about a week after the operation. Ever since, I've been experiencing reflux every single night, and I am absolutely miserable. My symptoms include: 

* Feeling stomach contents backing up into my esophagus, though 95% of the time it doesn't burn like acid 
* Insane amounts of gas buildup in my stomach that struggles to release, need to take Gas-X and/or get up and walk to coax it out 
* Tasting that weird acid flavor on the back of my tongue
* Persistent cough and lung irritation
* Sore/irritated throat 
* Occasional sensation like something is stuck down at the base of the esophagus 
* Not sure if related, but my eyes have been getting really red and irritated around the time of bad flare-ups??? 
* Post nasal drip
* Little gurgling noise and feeling in throat as gas escapes without a belch 
* Producing too much saliva (I think I've read that this is called water brash?) 


My doctor has me on cholestyramine once a day as a bile sequestrant, because we thought this might be bile reflux since it only really started post operation. It felt like this was helping at first, but now I'm not so sure; been taking it every day for nearly a month, and I'm in the middle of a worse-than-usual reflux party that started about 3 days ago. I  eat small meals, and avoid gluten, dairy, spicy and high fat foods. I stop eating about 3-4 hours before bed most nights, and my episodes last about that long. I sleep on a steep wedge pillow. 

Antacids only help sometimes, and they never truly stop the reflux. Getting rid of the gas buildup usually seems to be the thing that reduces the reflux most. I have a followup with my doctor in a week, and I'm pretty sure he'll put me on a PPI. 

Has anybody else had their GERD happen as a result of getting their gallbladder removed? Did your symptoms ever settle down a bit or have they always been this bad?

Hi all, this is my first post here. I've been on Copaxone for 17 years in April. (Wow. That went fast.) Over the first 16 years or so, I experienced intense IPIR maybe 3 or 4 times. 

Now, every single time I inject, it's happening to a lesser degree. But enough to make me fearful of continuing. Like clockwork, 10 minutes after, I get the tightness in my chest, flushing feelings. That lasts 10 or so minutes, then it's a bit of nausea as, I suppose, it works its way through my body. Then 30 minutes later, intense chills and body aches. Seems to happen irrespective of needle depth or injection site. 

This is just not sustainable. And everywhere I look, there are no answers. My neuro can't explain it, of course, but thinks I should switch to Vumerity. 

What has happened to me? Has it happened to you? Does Tylenol really help? Has anyone heard of anything else that helps?

Ive been sober for over 6 years. I do though continuously have petit mal everyday numerous times a day. For the past couple years Ive noticed an increase of the feeling like Im going to have a seizure. I get super super dizzy and immediately start sweating. My husband thinks its turning into a vertigo problem because my ears will start ringing also. It comes on strong especially if I have caffeine (even 1 cup of coffee) or if Im too tired or especially if I get hot. Im at a lost for what to do. I have been off meds for seizures for 5 years because they just never helped me. Does anyone else experience this an know what it is an what I should do? Any suggestions would be appreciated. Sometimes Ill wake up from a dream I was going to have a seizure and Ill be so dizzy like the whole room is spinning so fast and it wont stop for hours. Its super scary and frustrating.

So, I was recently diagnosed with temporal lobe epilepsy. I had 4 grand mals in a row, was hospitalized for a week, lost my license, etc. It was initially blamed on my meds (Adderall, Wellbutrin, and amitriptyline) but apparently I have an epileptic-looking brain (sclerotic configuration of something, blah blah blah) and I ended up having a seizure during my EEG and got sent to a neurologist. The neuro explained what other, more subtle types of seizures feel/look like and apparently I've been having them my whole life. I've actually had several big seizures before, but I have POTS so I thought it was just fainting (but dramatic). Anyways. 
They gave me dissolvable clonazepam as a rescue medication. Have an aura, take the meds, avoid seizures. The only problem is, it doesn't do the right thing. 
I took one when I started getting bad vibes and thought I would feel drowsy at the very least. It was the opposite. I felt anxious/aggressive/overjoyed at the same time, super energetic, couldn't sit still, etc. I was pacing around the apartment for hours and didn't sleep at all that night. I hoped it was a one-time occurrence and tried again another time and it was even worse. I had several focal seizures and took one of my sleeping pills (Dayvigo) when I was still awake at 4AM and starting to hallucinate. Stupid, I know. When I woke up, I was sore and confused like I'd had seizures in my sleep. I felt AWFUL. It's worth noting that I had two seizures in the hospital while doped up on Ativan and they told me that I was super restless whenever they gave me benzos in the hospital. 
A quick Google tells me that paradoxical reactions can happen, but I don't have any of the risk factors. I'm not at an age extreme, I don't drink very frequently, etc. It's just weird. Does anyone else have experience with this? What alternatives are there? 
Also, I take Adderall as well, which my neuro said was fine. I have a weird reaction to that, too. I take 20mg 2x/day, the second at night. I used to use it as a sleeping pill. It makes me calmer and relaxed, very different from the general population but normal for ADHD. Could they be connected?
ALSO, I'm allergic to some AEDs, which is making my life harder. None of the ones we've tried have been effective with tolerable side effects. I'm bipolar so the list of antidepressants I can take has dwindled to nothing, which is making my adjustment period even worse. Seriously, don't ever go cold turkey on two high dose antidepressants. It sucks. Does anyone know of antidepressants that are ok for people who are bipolar+epileptic other than lamotrigine? Or how to navigate AEDs with mental illness in general?

In my experience:
My first day was fine. I felt fine, I ate fine, I was just sleepy with a little chest pain from them pumping air into my abdomen. I do not suggest eating something right away once you get home. Go take a nap first. I threw up all my lunch and puked a little blood b/c I had biopsies done. I called my nurse and kept them in the loop. Do that if you vomit.

Second Day
I wouldn't say my throat hurt. Chest hurt a lot and I was more tired than usual. Talking increasingly became more and more exhausting by lunch time.
Don't go to work like I did.
Get ice cream and losegnes (however you spell those menthol things to suck on)
Eat only soft things.

Third Day
Same as 2nd day. Less chest pain.
I spoke softly with a whisper most of the day.
Mentally, I was loosing my mind.
Lots of popsicles.

Fourth Day
No chest pain. My normal energy is back.
Talking at my regular tone...but writing this during my lunch break, hoping my Toddler clients take a full 2 hour nap because I need to rest my voice for these two hours.
Not singing yet. Toddlers are disappointed. 3 days of naps with no lullabies. 

Anything else I missed?

Edit
Day Five early morning
I can sing a few notes now. Soreness comes and goes but again...it's not like my throat is sore...it's like my throat is fatigued. It's hard to describe.

Ice cream/Creamy Popsicles is better than Ice Popsicles. Ice pops just numb my mouth.

I know nobody can diagnose me! (:

Sooo some backstory; when I was around 15 (23 now) I was offhandedly told I had tachycardia and arrhythmia. No surprise there, I was constantly turned away from blood donation because my heart rate was over 100 resting. A year or two later a cardiologist told me I have SVT but it wasnt deadly and would probably just be annoying to experience at times. 

I was using an apple watch the other day (I'm assuming not super reliable but I dont know) and my resting rate was 94 and when I stood up it was 115. When I stand up I usually feel fluttering and pounding in my chest and feel clumsy and lightheaded but I thought that's just kinda what happens when you get up. 

I found this group through mentions of it in other groups I'm in of other diagnoses I have. I learned of blood pooling and noticed in myself my hands get red and splotchy a lot which again I assumed was normal. 

So what do ya think? Can tachycardia develop into POTS? Or maybe this was something I always dealt with. Not entirely sure. I'm already seeing 3 different doctors for other issues so adding a cardiologist to the list sounds super daunting!! If anyone has any advice or anything I welcome it.

I am not a doctor. I work in IT.

I've suffered from horrible gout since I was 23, I'm now 31. I get it in my fingers, toes, wrists, knees, and one elbow.

I take meds (allo and colchicine).

That being said, my Rheumatologist thinks that my kidneys and liver have a hard time clearing uric acid out of my blood rather than I ingest too many purines.

For this reason diet helps minimally .

A couple years back I heard a study in India doing full blood transfusions for people with sever gout and having some success.

So I started donating blood every 2 months(maximum times allowed). This helped quite a bit to manage my UA levels.

After reading that uric acid is carried  in the blood by plasma, I looked up plasma donation.

Plasma donation centers allow you donate 2x a week because they pull the plasma out of your blood, give you back your red blood cells, and then give you saline to replace the plasma.

Plus, they pay me $50 every time I donate, so I make an extra $400 a month.

That's besides the point, I would pay them to take my plasma because it seems to help reduce UA by straight up taking it out of my blood.

Lately Ive had an even more difficult time with swallowing saliva, water, food. Pretty much everything. I feel like it gets caught right past my mouth. I never choke, but I do throat clear a lot and find myself with that wet voice occasional. This all started a couple of weeks back and I experienced epigastric pain with shortness of breath as well. Ive been prescribed omeprazole twice a day by an ENT and have cut out a lot of offending foods the last couple of weeks.

Im concerned its neurological. Im only in my 20s, but Im freaking out.

262,sdpmhj,t5_2saq9,"Unsure but need advice
Following my pregnancy (about 4 years ago) I started having dizzy spells, fainting, heart racing, sweating, getting too hot and feeling faint from standing too long, etc. I was diagnosed with PPA. I dont doubt I have anxiety that gets worked up when I think Im dying (aka unexplained fainting and heart racing) because after having my daughter my mortality was something that I became very aware of. On and off for the past 4 years I have had these symptoms and my dr tells me to take Ativan because its a panic attack and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesnt which is odd. Also, I was being tested for a family autoimmune disorder about 2 years ago and was getting X-rays and was on a tilt table to move the liquid around my bowels. I almost passed out when they moved me upwards but they said its the shock of the liquid on my system and not eating (2 day fast required)- made sense to me! I ended up in the ER last weekend with heart racing, dizziness, nausea, exhaustion, and an almost fainting episode. They said - youre healthy, take Ativan.I have been under A LOT of stress over the past 6 weeks and my body is not having it. 

But I started watching my heart rate more and more lately and when I go from laying down (feeling pretty good) HR: 63 to standing HR:118 I feel faint, dizzy, numbness in my feet and hands and they longer I stand the worse it gets.I started tracking this daily. But Im worried about bringing POTS up to my dr in fear that it will be brushed off as anxiety. Any advice on advocating for a tilt table test? I just dont want to be brushed off. Im tired of only feeling better/good when Im laying down. I feel lazy and useless but I genuinely only feel better laying down.

I (34F) did a formal tilt table test yesterday. It didn't feel terrible, but the tech also told me to ""do what you have to do"" with my leg muscles, so I was flexing and fidgeting kind of a lot to take pressure off my heels.  I also wasn't told to hold  salt or my SSRI before the test, though I did hold several other meds and supplements as instructed. I felt mildly symptomatic the day of the test, but not a big flare.  

These were the raw results:

> In response to 70 degree head up tilt, the patient's heart rate has increased from 66 bpm up to 96 bpm at 9 minutes then up to 109 bpm at 18 minutes of 70 degree head up tilt. No significant changes were noted in the blood pressure.

The interpretation was ""mild orthostatic intolerance."" I messaged to ask why it wasn't considered POTS, because of the 30 BPM rise in the first ten minutes. The RN responded:

> Because the heart rate did not go over 100 in the first 9 minutes. Tachycardia is defined as a heart rate over 100 beats per minute. 

Because I didn't ""meet the criteria for POTS"", they said my catecholamine blood tests results won't be relevant. I'm worried that they're going to disregard my symptoms entirely.

285,rfl5g7,t5_2s1h9,"Thermocoagulation SEEG time before it goes back to normal
I had a SEEG at the Montreal Neuro and the whole procedure went flawlessly. I did the whole neurostimulation which was out of this world: they were able to reproduce my auras based on the seizures I had in the emu while having the deep implantation. Honestly, medicine/neuroscience is crazy. 

That being said, the surgeon proposed to do a thermocoagulation of the suspected/99%-confirmed-area which would basically reduce or kill away my auras/seizures (this is temporarily until the area heals itself). They did this with the same implants they used during the SEEG right before the explantation. This could lead to further confirmation of the culprit epileptic area. 

It's been about 14 days since this happened and so far I had 0 auras/seizures which is AMAZING as prior to this I had up to 30 auras per day or even more; I stopped counting a while back. 

Now, the surgeon in collaboration with the other neuros are working towards finding the right plan for my resection surgery but since it's Canada it might take a little time, hopefully less than 6 months.

My question is: For all of you that had the thermocoagulation, how long did it take for your brain to heal and start to have the auras back?

306,s9dzea,t5_2s23e,"Gabapentin & neuropathy
Hi everyone,

Im relatively new here, but Ive found so much helpful advice since I was diagnosed in December (33/fRRMS). Thank you!! 

Today I take my second loading dose of Kesimpta. I saw my neuro on Wednesday, and she prescribed me gabapentin to help with neuropathy in my hands, thighs, and the bottoms of my feet. She said I can take up to 900mg a day, or 3 pills, depending on how I feel. Kind of vague instructions, but there you goIm not sure that its that kind of drug, i.e. one that has a relatively immediate effect, like ibuprofen, but perhaps I misunderstood her. 

Ive taken one gabapentin before bed the past two nights. I know a side effect is drowsiness, but it makes me sooo drowsylike fall-asleep-sitting-up drowsy. 

Ive read that this and other common side effects subside within a week or two, and I really want to try this drug to see if it helps; I work with books and, uh, use my hands a lot! My hands (mostly fingers) are by far the worst, and the sudden onset of neuropathy in my fingers is the reason I sought medical tests in the fall.  The numbness and/or tingling has been driving me insane. It has been consistent in my hands since a week before Halloween (and same with skin on my stomachnot sure if its the MS hug, however), and more recently + less intensely it has been on my thighs and the bottom of my feet.  Some days are worse than others, which Ive definitely learned is normal from reading posts on here. Blah! 

Back to gabapentin: I am hesitant to take a second pill mid-afternoon prior to the one before bed, simply because it had made me so tired the last couple of nights. I really dont want to fall asleep in the middle of the dayone reason I dont take Benadryl, no matter how bad allergies are, unless Im going to bed!

307,rkqq2c,t5_2qlaa,"LPR in elderly
Im writing looking for any advice, ideas, anything really that could be remotely helpful. So my 81 year old grandmother has been really poorly for about 6 weeks now. The first day it started we had to ring an ambulance for her because her breathing was so bad.

After in hospital tests they found she had several heart problems and have put all her breathing issues down to that. However after being on relevant medication nothing seems to be improving. We have had paramedics out 10 times in 6 weeks, and she has been in hospital at least 3 times but every time they discharge her as her vitals are apparently fine. 

After looking into LPR I was actually surprised at how many of the symptoms she had. No burning, but a constant intense heavy feeling on her chest, constant breathless which seems to get worse (almost like an attack) at random times (but also after eating without fail). Shes been complaining about post nasal drip and phlegm, and we had actually noticed for awhile before all this kicked off that she had been having issues with hoarseness and excessive throat clearing. She also has a kind of muscle soreness just below her ribs, and seems unable to be able to breath into her stomach at all. 

Ive mentioned this to the gp when he came out to see her but didnt seem to be interested. The first time he prescribed some antacids but they didnt seem to help. Though Ive read that they often dont for people who already have damage to the esophagus? 

The breathlessness is constant now and despite her vitals being fine she constantly feel as though shes dying. I definitely think anxiety exacerbates the symptoms, however I do not think its the cause. 

Its hard to make life style changes at her age, even before the breathlessness she had trouble moving around and exercise is impossible. She also doesnt drink coffee or smoke, and even eating low acid foods doesnt seem to be helping. 

We are at a loss about what to do now. Me and my mum have practically had to move in with her to make sure there is always someone with her when the breathing gets to it worst, even though theres nothing we can do shes terrified of being alone during these episodes.

Shes practically bed bound by it, the few feet journey to the toilet badly affects her. She still has her full mental capacity and living like this is really getting to her and Im worried shes becoming really depresssed. Doctors dont seem to listen. Theyve prescribed her a very low dose of morphine but that doesnt seem to be helping either.

Just a quick back story:  37 year old male.  Clean off opioiods since 2018; and since coming off decades of use my GI tract just hated me (for those who don't know opiates and GI go hand and hand) - so anyhow, since 2018 it has been diaherra no matter what I ate -

Right, ok, I'm getting older and part of that is chronic pain and my back is another issue in my life and when it flares up life just comes to a stand still - and it just felt like IBS is on the same level of that type of hidden, crippling, pain.

Took up using cannabis in the mornings and that was great - it really helped the SYMPTOMS yet not the underlining issue.

Last week, exactly one week - I got Food Poisioning.  Spent four hours on my hands and knees in the bath tub shower dry heaving letting the water run over me.  It was exhausting, draining - and honestly helped me because two days later when I finally fell asleep and woke up with my usual sour stomach, nausea, explosive BM, pain -- well, it was like PTSD.  I've been living with this pain for so long and even with diet and exercise (I'm in great shape per being a gym rat and am very aware of my diet and work in a seafood restaurant, so I've been eating a lot of LIVING food - lots of grilled fish, fresh vegetables, grits and grilled shrimp, etc.)

So the pain from this IBS just reached a point where - well, it got too much.  So this is what I did.

I bought a pack of Dannon Probiotic Yogurt Drinks.  I bought a $5 VitaValue PROBIOTIC GUT BLEND capsules from Dollar General  for $5 (That oddly you can't find anywhere on Google...) and I bought a lot of Fiber One Coffee Cakes.

and within 48 hours, it was amazing.   I'm on to Day 3 I woke up this morning and it was amazing.  I didn't feel nausea, I didn't need to inhale cannabis - my BM was still watery yet the pain was absent.

Its like my stomach works the exact opposite of everyone elses. Everyone says that eating foods rich in fiber will help digestion and whatnot. For me however, the exact opposite happens. If I eat oats, muesli, bread or anything else rich in fiber, I get diarrhea and bloating.

However, I can eat extreme amounts of meats without any issues at all. Most people feel ""heavy"" and bogged down after eating lots of meat, especially red meat. I feel just fine, no issues at all. I once ate over 1kg (2 lbs) of red meat in one sitting at an all you can eat restaurant (I know its not healthy) and I felt great whereas my friends hardly could move and felt sick.

The thing is that everyone always pointing out the importance of a diet rich in fiber kind of gets to me and it feels like I am doing the wrong thing.

Should I force myself to eat more fibers and hope that my upset stomach gets better with time? I have tried it before several times by gradually increasing the amount of fiber but even really small amounts makes my stomach go haywire.

In all I realized that I went trough a lot of dissociation, hallucinations, psychotic breaks etc. and that that time I was not even aware of it.

I never stopped and ask myself if it was normal.

Now that Ive ben diagnosed and taking antipsychotics its getting a little bit better.

My psychiatrist and therapist really are really helping me and expanding a lot of things about psychosis that I didnt even know.

318,sb95ay,t5_2saq9,"IBS issues worse/digestive system processing quickly with increased exercise?
Hi all - I have a question for the group and would like to see if this is a shared experience. For context, I have a hyperadrenergic POTS diagnosis, IBS-C (for constipation), and SIBO diagnosis. I am seeing a POTS specialist and GI specialist. Im on corlanor/ivabradine for my POTS (which has helped a lot!) and I take trulance 3mg as my prescription laxative. For context I am gluten free and dairy free this has helped as well. I did a motility test last year and the result was normal. Positive for SIBO through breath test.

Recently Ive been able to exercise on my recumbent bike and go on long walks 3/4 days out of the week which has been a huge improvement for me. The thing is, with the increased activity level, I have noticed my appetite is close to 0 and when I eat, I can feel the stomach acid is more intense/heart burn and it almost feels like my body is processing the food is quickly as possible (bowel movements 15 minutes after eating sometimes I see solid pieces of what looks like food? TMI but always diarrhea).

When I wake up in the morning the area seems sort of sweaty and raw. I am currently on Keppra 250g twice a day and Tegretol 400mg in morning and 200mg in evening. They want me to go up to 800mg of Tegretol in a day but doing it slowly as I believe Im allergic to it.

Not completely symptom free yet but feel that what I have done lately has helped a ton and hope others may find some benefit.

&#x200B;

1. Ginger Tea (no green tea/ black tea/ coffee / any other types of tea make sure its decaf. and no citrus teas -- i'd just stick with ginger tho its helped me significantly)
2. Gaviscon (fairly cheap on amazon, stock up. Way better than tums imo)
3. Ginger gum (preferred) or xylitol gum to ease saliva production in the back of throat.
4. Scraping tongue, especially near around the papilla (very back of of the tongue). I use a skinny metal one in order to reach there (all of this stuff can be bought on Amazon).  My tongue used to get so disgusting that I've gone through two courses of anti-candida albacans pills.
5. Walking. 10,000 - 15,000 steps a day is my goal. More the better.
6. Sleeping upright and elevating my head. Just bought a wedge pillow but was using a lapdesk before. Really elevate your head too, like your upper back should be elevated.
7. Everyone is different but for me: no onions, garlic, tomatoes, oranges, fried, greasy, oily (basically no fast food), no pizza, no cheese, no spicy foods, no cow's milk, i drink soy..
8. DGL Licorice Root Extract tablet 30 mins before a meal.
9. Eating tums alongside PPI like omeprazole. Dr. told me that PPI reduces acid but does not neutralize it so take some bicarb alongside it which is basically tums. Pepcid also sells a variant that includes some bicarb as well. But, the PPI + tums works better for me. I also take Pepcid as needed. Also, make sure you eat something after you take your PPI 30-60mins after you consumed the PPI or else the PPI wont be nearly as effective.
10. Netti kettle for sinus. 1 packet of salt per each nostril. I got mine from CVS. I have a deviated septum confirmed by an ENT. (is it worth correcting with surgery?)
11. Make sure your allergies do not flare up. I take a steroid nasal spray and take Claritin. I also take  Pseudoephedrine as a preventative measure for post nasal drip but my ent advised me not too for reasons i forgot. I still take it cuz i feel it helps.
12. Been going through the acid watchers diet book and they recommend eating a lb of vegetables a day. 0.5 raw and 0.5 cooked. Raw to include brocoli, carrots, spinach, etc. Cooked your choice. Havent done this yet myself but plan too. I do try to eat veggies but a 1 lb wow. gotta do what u gotta do.
13. all foods should be ideally of ph 5 or above. If im unsure if i can eat it i just google what is the ph of xyz food?

Been suffering for over 1 year now. I dont really get heart burn (unless i eat gross) just throat issues including excessive mucus/saliva production on one side of the throat in the very back which i suspect is from acid/water brash as a result of GERD. Throat tightness, irritation, and inflammation to the tissue at the back of the throat. Beltching throughout the day.

Seeing a GI next week. Been to an ENT three times and they basically told me to take 80 mg of  a PPI, go on a strict low-acid diet, and lose weight. Did an endoscopy twice and ENT said there was a lot of inflammation in the throat. I stopped going to the ENT but may reach out to them if my new GI Dr. is crappy. If anyone has any suggestions when I see the GI I'd appreciate that. I didnt know at the time but I would of def. gone to a GI before an ENT as it appears from my research that a GI is just generally better at treating GERD. Makes sense since I'm not really satisfied with my ENT.

Hi everyone so for about a little over a week (since the night of 12/11) ive been having gerd like symptoms.

First my symptoms were 
Shortness of Breath (especially when laying down) 
Insomnia (cant sleep at all)
Diarrhea 
No appetite
Lightheadedness 
Chills 
Post Nasal Drip
Muted Taste

I went to 2 different ERs and they both did an X-Ray of my lungs, ECG, COVID test and CBC w/ Diff all came back normal. They told me everything was fine and that it could just be an virus.

With that in mind i spent the rest of the week off work at home, trying to fight the assumed virus. I took asthma meds to help breathing and nothing helped, i also took vitamin c to help my body fight what ever it is. 

Since around the 19th I now have more symptoms along with the previous ones 
Bad Breath
Lump feeling in throat
Burping A lot
Stomach keeps rumbling
Dry mouth
Regurgitate food

Yesterday (12/20) I went to a doctor and he said he didnt know what it could be. I asked him if this could be GERD and he said no because it wouldnt make me short of breath and it wouldnt just happen suddenly. He said that i could possibly just have a stomach virus. He gave me Famotidine 20mg and Metoclopramide 10mg and so far they help a little.

My questions are does this sound like GERD to yall and is it true GERD is progressive and not acute, i barely turned 20 and have never had heartburn or acid reflux before.

Hi everyone so for about a little over a week (since the night of 12/11) ive been having gerd like symptoms.

First my symptoms were 
Shortness of Breath (especially when laying down) 
Insomnia (cant sleep at all)
Diarrhea 
No appetite
Lightheadedness 
Chills 
Post Nasal Drip
Muted Taste

I went to 2 different ERs and they both did an X-Ray of my lungs, ECG, COVID test and CBC w/ Diff all came back normal. They told me everything was fine and that it could just be an virus.

With that in mind i spent the rest of the week off work at home, trying to fight the assumed virus. I took asthma meds to help breathing and nothing helped, i also took vitamin c to help my body fight what ever it is. 

Since around the 19th I now have more symptoms along with the previous ones 
Bad Breath
Lump feeling in throat
Burping A lot
Stomach keeps rumbling
Dry mouth
Regurgitate food

Yesterday (12/20) I went to a doctor and he said he didnt know what it could be. I asked him if this could be GERD and he said no because it wouldnt make me short of breath and it wouldnt just happen suddenly. He said that i could possibly just have a stomach virus. He gave me Famotidine 20mg and Metoclopramide 10mg and so far they help a little.

My questions are does this sound like GERD to yall and is it true GERD is progressive and not acute, i barely turned 20 and have never had heartburn or acid reflux before.

19M 100kg

I have not been diagnosed with anything yet but I've been dealing with just mild heartburn for a month now. Started taking PPI's now with a 2nd course of 4 weeks (my first course was a fail since I didn't follow what my GP said and rubbish diet so I'm starting again advised from GP).


It all started when I had bad anxiety. Drank alot of alcohol during the night last month before I started having problems. I drank alot and then my mother made a really hot spicy thai food which I eaten after. 

I went to shower after  and noticed my stomach was burning badly and painfully. I thought it was spicy food and hoping it will stop. It was uncomfortable and still had it hours after showering and carried on while I was going to bed. 

While I was sleeping, i had the most intense heartburn ever in my entire life. Woke up at 2am getting out of bed suffering. I started to have panic attacks because it was scaring the shit out of me

Since I had nothing to do about it to stop it, I had to just force myself to sleep or at least try to and I did. Woke up with less severe heartburn but something felt not right. I had a cheeseburger and my stomach was on fire and hurting me. Didn't eaten anything all day until PPI started to help me abit and burn in the stomach disappeared. 

What I'm treating myself:
-PPI's (lansoprozole 30mg)
-Inclined while sleeping (incase something plays up but nothing happens. Still carrying on doing it though just incase)

A month gone by, my only symptoms is:

- mild Heart burn or burn sensation in the upper chest area. (Always persistent) 

I don't have:

-Coughing up acid 
-Regurgitation
-throat pain
-Nasal drip
-Stomach pain or feel burning in the stomach
- No belching 
-Irritation on the voice box 
-Wheezing
-Difficulty of swallowing
-Sensation lump on the throat
-shortness of breath

That's pretty much it. That's all I'm dealing with just mild heartburn. Im getting tested for pylori and the test won't come back in couple of weeks maybe.

TW: Abuse i guess

Recently I (16 f) was diagnosed with a generalized seizure disorder after being ignored for 3 years by my parents and begging to see a doctor who can actually do something (The family doctor is controlled by my parents so whatever they say goes.) They still think I'm not sick when the EEG came up abnormal, everyone has seen me have many different types of seizures before AND IVE BEEN DIAGNOSED! They don't give me my medications at the right time, miss my appointments with the neurologists and neglect my overall mental and physical heath too. I had a large tonic clonic episode in the afternoon and passed out after but as usual they left me on the floor. The keppra isn't doing much and neither are they. I can barely walk or move my muscles. I'm exhausted. THEY KNOW I could have brain damage at this point but they don't seem bothered.

I failed final exams this year because I was almost dead writing them. I came home in the rain one evening and they dragged me across the floor half naked and forced me to crawl up the stairs while verbally and physically assaulting me. I was barely conscious but the pain was enough for me to run away in the morning when I could barely walk.  I'm afraid to have seizures because of how they handle me.  I have to supress myself so I don't feel humiliated.

I know they're abusive but I can't leave this situation or do anything for myself now. I've tried everything and every service to remove myself from their ""care"" but they wont help. Not the police.

This is long so thank you for taking the time to read. 
26F, 55 116 lbs, white, symptoms started September 7, 2021. I dont drink or do any drugs, I worked out 6x a week, usually HIIT style, resting HR was 50bpm
That morning I woke up and had a bit of a headache so I decided to go on a run, it wasnt supposed to be 6 miles but I wanted to see the end of the trail so I kept going. Half way through the clouds burned off and it hit 90 degrees. Very hilly trail but I kept trying to jog. Then my HR hit 190 so I walked until it lowered, every time I tried jogging again it immediately spiked. My whole body was red that whole day and that night began my issues. I awoke for 2 hrs in the middle of the night. Next night for 4 hours. Then 6 hours. Then I just didnt fall asleep for more than 1 hour. I also had a high resting heart rate (65-75bpm sitting) that spiked when I stood or even walked a little bit to 90-100bpm. I went to the ER and all their tests were normal. They gave me an Ativan which did nothing.  Then I tried a weed gummy and started sleeping for a week before that stopped helping. For a while I would only get 2 hrs sleep a night. I slowly increased it to 6-8hrs with melatonin, unisom, magnesium and lavender. But it never lasts more than 2 weeks. During these times my resting Hr is normal (low 50s) but still spikes when I walk to mid 80s. Then I flare and cant really sleep for 1-3 weeks even though I take the same stuff-during this time my resting HR is low 60s, 7-10 bpm higher. Spikes when walking are 100s. These episodes have been getting worse, Im on 3 days of no sleep right now, 8 days of 4 or less hrs. My muscles are weaker and fatigue fast and my joints dont really feel stable, lots of cracking. I noticed a blue patch in the sclera of each eye which was never there before. I have some gi issues and sometimes frequent urination at night like I have a UTI but I dont. I had a normal EKG, echocardiogram, and brain MRI with and without contrast. Normal blood work, metabolic panel, TSH (.466) negative ANA. Three weeks before my symptoms, I hit my head in the same spot I hit my head where I got a concussion one year before. Could this just be POTS? My Hr doesnt spike the full 30 all of the time, not when my sleep is normal. Im not hyper mobile and no family hx of disease.

342,sp88ul,t5_2s23e,"Ocrevus Experience
I am just one person, but here has been my experience on Ocrevus.

I was diagnosed with MS in 2020 with 6 total lesions and a few active ones on my optic nerve and spine. I was 22 at the time of my diagnosis and they believe they caught my MS early.

I started Ocrevus a few months later. Ocrevus, for those who dont know, is a strong DMT you do via IV infusion twice a year.

About 2 months after my first infusion, my MS symptoms (sensory issues and left eye optic neuritis) had disappeared completely.

They started to reappear slightly and sporadically in the 6 weeks leading up to my next infusion. The symptom reappearance became more frequent as I got closer in time to being due for another infusion. I was dealing with depression and debilitating chronic fatigue at this time, which may have been intermingled.

After that second infusion, the fatigue and sensory symptoms waned away completely after about a month. I felt normal for a while. Now Im 4 weeks out from my next infusion and Im getting sporadic tingling and numbness that reminds me of my old constant symptoms, but the sensory stuff isnt enough to interfere with my life. 

My MRIs have improved so dramatically that my previous neurologist suggested I might not even have MS and wanted to do another lumbar puncture. Im switching neurologists from her to the guy who diagnosed me for multiple reasons, mostly because she didnt listen to a thing I said or remember anything about my medical history. She was rude, depressing as hell, and patronizing. Her notes were also biased and suggested my sensory symptoms were psychosomatic. *rolls eyes in multiple sclerosis*

I just got some MRIs done last night. No new lesions to explain the sporadic, transient reoccurrence of sensory and ocular symptoms.

Also, in regards to being immunocompromised on Ocrevus; I havent gotten COVID-19 throughout this entire pandemic despite working in a field where I have to be in-person with clients everyday. Ive gotten all my vaccines, wash my hands regularly, and wear the best masks I can at work and in public. I also keep an eye on the charts and avoid going out to eat or drink during spikes in cases.

TLDR: I was diagnosed early and my symptoms are mostly sensory. Ocrevus seems to be making my symptoms go away completely for a while.",claim_per_exp,"

351,ry0ajh,t5_2s23e,"Maybe a Silly Question
Hello all, 

Is it possible to have start a DMT (for me, Ocrevus), and just never relapse ever again? Or at least, until I am like old? Is that a thing? I understand everybody progesses through the levels of MS at somepoint in their life. 

I've (22M) only been diagnosed with MS for two years, and the attack (optic neuritis) that started it all is the only relapse I have ever had. I deal with fatigue and the hug every so often, I have had headaches more often, and my joints ache sometimes, especially at night (this i have learned is a side effect of Ocrevus), but not anything crazy. For the most part, I live my life just like I did before my diagnoses, and for that I am EXTREMELY grateful. 

In total, I have two lesions. I started with one when I was first diagnosed, and then a year later I had another teeny tiny one. I assume this was just because I opted to not start a DMT due to being pretty scared of Covid. In December, I finally started Ocrevus, and it feels like a huge weight off my shoulders. I guess, I was scared of being deemed immunocompromised, and in my head I made this scary fantasy that I was going to be sick all the time (I have a terrible fear of throwing up). Suffice to say, that did not happen, and I feel pretty much exactly the same as I did before I started Ocrevus. 

Anyway, recently I have been getting really scared about my future, and the possible disability that could follow, both mental and physical. I read online that people who are diagnosed younger tend to have more mental issues, than those diagnosed later. This scares the piss out of me. It brings tears to my eyes because there is so much I want to do with my life, like I am currently trying to teach myself Korean because my dream is to teach in Korea. However, I feel like this is wasted time because I wont know who or where I am when I am 35. I currently work as a Home Health Aide at an assisted living in a memory care ward, and I love it. And dont get me wrong, I LOVE MY RESIDENTS, they might as well be family, but at the same time, I am terribly afraid of losing my memory like that. It really really freaks me out. And I see their families, and how sad they get when they see their husband, wife, mom, dad, etc progress further in their dementia, and I dont ever want to do that to my family. I know that MS and dementia arent really related, except maybe in the fact that they both cause brain atrophy. I dont know, I am just scared of possible mental and physical disability that MS can cause.

FINALLY TO MY QUESTION: is it possible that me, being on Ocrevus, could never experience another relapse due to my DMT, and just maintain a relatively normal life, for the reat of my life?

The only reason I ask this is because when I first got diagnosed my neuro said something along the lines of, ""the goal of DMTs is to make your MS the most boring diagnoses you have ever had, and someday after being relapse free for sometime, albeit far in the future, you can come off your DMT"". And due to me being so worried about my future recently, what my neuro said has really been weighing on my mind heavy. And it has been comforting me quite a bit. I guess I just want to know if this is based in reality, or if this was just something she was saying to a scared 20 year old guy who didnt know his ass from his elbow about MS to try to comfort me in my blatant distress.

Regardless, I have this determination to never be disabled, and if I am, I will never ever have it bring me down. This I do know for sure. Maybe it is my hubris, but I dont really give a shit. I want to live my life, and I'll be damned if my nerves dont agree with me. My heart has been set ablaze.

353,sxxju9,t5_2s3g1,"IBS-C, COVID, and a heck of a lot of bloating
Hi! Long time lurker, first time poster here. Sorry, I just wanted to ask anyone who may know any home remedies for my current problem.

First off, I've been weaning off laxative dependence ever since my old arrogant GI insisted I rely on Bisacodyl suppositories, which led me to not only be dependent on them, but also gain so much water weight, suffer water retention in my legs, ankles, and feet, and suffer bouts of bloating and acid reflux.

This same GI also ghosted me, so there's that.

A lot of articles and home remedies have helped me wean off the laxatives, and it's been for the better. I went from needing suppositories everyday to pooping about twice a day thanks to healthy doses of magnesium every meal alongside an increased helping of fruits, mainly apples and bananas. We also removed complex fibers from my diet. In the few weeks I've experimented with my diet, I found that this was the routine that works.

However, ever since I tested positive for COVID about a week ago, the bloating and weird feelings of mass in my abdomen has never stopped. Usually, when I bloat, it gets relieved by pooping and/or passing gas, but during this time with COVID, it's just been one continuous, painful ballooning.

During my first few days with COVID, I wasn't able to poop or even pass gas in 3 days. With the help of stool softeners and magnesium citrate though, my body was able to discharge a good amount of waste from my bowels. However, the bloating never stopped. I still felt lumps, and generally, the poop just never felt ""complete"". I assumed I'd be able to let more out if we just continued treatment.

So, after all that, I'd still been regularly taking my daily dosages of magnesium citrate and stool softeners. It's only until 2 days ago that I began pooping everyday, but they were only small amounts. I still felt big moving masses in my colon.

Feeling desperate, and with an online consultation from a surgeon friend, we opted for me to take one suppository, just earlier today (as of this writing). It helped me pass most, if not all the gas that was built up inside me, and helped me poop some more, but I still feel at least one big moving mass in my colon. I've been under the assumption that it would just be one big mass of poop, but with my bathroom trips rendering me small, softer poops with some water in it, I'm beginning to worry it's something else.

But if it's for anything, the suppository still did relieve my bloating, even just for a few hours. I'm still bedridden, COVID-positive, and the bloating grew back. I feel like the mass I had been feeling has moved down to the point I barely feel it anymore, but my abdomen notably feels tired, stretched out, and in pain whenever I move.

Do you guys think this is just my IBS-C being exacerbated by COVID? What can I do to relieve the bloating?

Some additional context:
- My COVID is being treated at home since my symptoms are just mild, and we quite frankly can't afford hospitalization at the moment.
- I am currently 28. I've had chronic constipation ever since childhood, but I was officially diagnosed with IBS when I was 17. My first GI was great, but unfortunately passed away, resulting in me having to seek out a new GI, who is crusty, old, arrogant, and ghosted me when I had been scheduling for the follow-up checkup they themself prescribed. I say they're arrogant because they just kept invalidating the decisions and diagnoses my old GI had done, and insisted I be reliant on all sorts of laxatives, disregarding my lifestyle.

Do I have GERD?

Back in October I went out drinking and end up getting sick that night. Since that it always felt like a lump in throat and food was not going down. Leading up to that, when I drink alcohol or coffee it would be hard to eat but went away over night like nothing happened, so I never really worried about it. This time the lump would go away after a week, so I went to my primary care doctor. She gave me PPI and then a steroid pill for the inflammation. My issues got worse, no sure if it because I wasnt eating, but my stomach started feeling full and indignation like crazy.  

I went to a GI doctor and he did a endoscopy. The test came back with inflammation in the upper and lower esophagus with swelling in the stomach (gastritis). All mild inflammation, nothing trapping food. I also did a esophageal manometry, which came back normal. My LES pressure was perfect. 

After a month and half my symptoms are slowly going away. The only thing remaining is: sore throat, feel like good getting stuck in throat, burping when I eat (nothing crazy). I have chest pain but its dull pain that last like 30 second on the side of chest (under boob). Not sure if thats heartburn.

363,suxpxk,t5_2s3g1,"Any suggestions or advice for PI-IBS/IBS M?
Things have been getting worse and worse during the last year, after I was told to take some oil of oregano for SIBO. I used to go once a day with constipation, but after that oil of oregano for 3 months last year, I've been needing to go the toilet 5 or more times a day. 

It's not diarrhea, it's sometimes small pellets, sometimes bigger sized balls, and I'll need to go quite close together. It's like it's one poop as a load of smaller ones. 

Sometimes it comes out so easily, and I find I'm not straining as much. But bowel movements are just too often and too fast.

I started leaking mucus at the end of 2020, because I was on laxatives for constipation,  needed the toilet but there was someone in there. So, I stuck a finger up there to see how close I was to going. I had never done that before! I just panicked. But I was basically normal before I did that.

A few seconds later - mucus came out! I hoped it'd be a one off, but then it started happening only before a bowel movement. I get wetter the longer I hold it. Then eventually it started leaking all the time, and I'm starting to feel like I've broken something that can ever be fixed. Then I started the oil of oregano I mentioned earlier.

My biggest issues right now:

- Frequency 
- Urgency 
- Leaking mucus

I've tried a lot of different things. Different probiotics, some diet changes. The only things that help are drinking a lot of water and doing 24hr water fasting, where my issues disappear. Today was the first time I've ever done water fasting, and I'm wondering how to keep doing it safely. 

I've got some antispasmodics (mebeverine) from my gp. Waiting to try that because I'm getting an (unrelated) surgery soon and don't want to add new meds in right now.

I've seen 3 gastroenterologists in the last 3 years. The last one discharged me after one negative inflammation test. I've never had any physical tests done aside from stool samples and blood tests, and a walk-in clinic doctor who confirmed last year that I have hemorrhoids. 

I tend to wipe yellow or clear mucus, and it leaks out as those colours, too. 

Lactobacillious probiotics make things worse. A lot of meds make it worse.

Any help would be appreciated, I'm a young adult and I can't live my whole life like this just because I took some oil of oregano.

Its been a long process but my first infusion is tomorrow. I have bumps all over my hands, knees, feet. And many other places. Never had a gout med or diet work. Its been getting worse.  So for you severe uncontrollable gout peeps out there. I will keep you informed.

The infusion itself wasnt bad I was there for about 3 hours.  I couldnt sleep hardly at all that night (because of the steroids that are injected first). We I woke up the next morning I felt good and felt great on Saturday. More movement in my joints and my hands didnt hurt hardly at all. Sunday same felt great. Monday and Tuesday I started feeling a little tired.  Then Wednesday came. My knee started hurting in the middle of the night then as the day progressed everything started hurt neck, back, shoulders, hips, knees and feet. I called today and they said with it breaking all the tophi up its going to cause flair ups.  And are putting me on prednisone to help. My iron acid levels came from a 8 to a .2!!!  So I am still very very optimistic about the treatment.  The hurting doesnt feel like a flair up it feels like getting your ass kicked.  Luckily I can still sleep with out propping whatever part of my body on a pillow and waking up to reposition.  Next one is in a week and I hope this all gets better soon. 


Just a little history I have tophi on all my fingers, both elbows, both knees, feet and even my Achilles tendons.  So its a lot that has built up for probably 10 years.  I work on cars so with all these ailments its getting very tough.  Lots of frustrations with other providers.  One cut my finger open thinking it was an infection. Another injected one of the tophi with cortisone.  Those were both early stages of it starting.  I use to play hockey 2-3 times a week and havent been able to at all in years now.  I am 5 9 150 lbs.

372,qhjdao,t5_2r876,"removing scarred tissue from the lungs.
This is all just a rather lengthy 'shower thought' and general curiosity. :)  


So I have chronic bronchiectasis. and have a fairly distinct and concentrated patch of scarred tissue on the central area of my left lung.  The rest of my lungs are remarkably healthy for someone with CF.

  
Additionally I have had an infection on my chest (focused around the left lung) which has persisted for nearly 2 years now and it makes me wonder if that scarred tissue is the root cause (lower blood flow, poorer immune response etc). Also potentially this area is a ""safe haven"" for the infection which is allowing it to drip feed the infection into the rest of my lung. (This is all uneducated guessing, pure speculation).  


So a friend of mine has only one lung, and the remaining lung has somewhat expanded to sort of fill the space and this lead me to wonder. If that scarred part of my lung were to be removed would the rest of the lung expand into the area? not regenerating it per se, but at the very least making better use of the space and removing the source of infection.

How common is it for people with few to no risk factors to have gout? I have no family history of gout. I'm not obese (though I do carry some extra weight). I have always consumed very little red meat (a few times per year), and very little beer, never more than 1 or 2 at a time and in recent years almost none. I don't eat sweets or drink soft drinks. I've always been pretty active and healthy, though I do have arthritis in several joints that predate my first gout flares.

I have kept a record of all my flares and salmon (which many sites say is not bad for gout) and seafood seem to have triggered at least 2/3 of my flares. I have been eating more animal protein and fewer carbs since last December, which helped me lose 10 lbs but also may have led to having 2 gout flares in 1 month. So I'm revising my diet again.

I guess the one risk factor I do have in abundance is stress.  I lost my job after months of retaliation and defamatory lies made against me and began a years long battle culminating in a failed lawsuit. The stress was off the charts, and the effects on my career and financial situation will never really go away.

I joined some time back and reading everyones posts makes me feel at ease. I want to share and rant a little bit because its so crazy how many different symptoms come from GERD. 
I had a sore throat from like mid 2017 to late 2020 which would get worse during the evenings. At that time I had relocated to a new city and i figured it was some allergy to new pollens which I didnt get exposed to back home. I would feel so fatigued. My chest hurt constantly and I felt pressure and some type of gargling at the top of my stomach. For some time I became paranoid thinking it was cancer or that I had hurt myself somehow, but every time I mentioned it to my doctor he would dismiss it as allergies and attribute the irritation to post nasal drip.  I got tested for H.Poly multiple times, got a full sti panel but nothing would show up. I would take Benadryl and omeprazole to manage, but it would make me so drowsy and I ended up sleeping a lot after work which didnt help my depression. It was difficult to swallow food and for some reason I would get hiccups frequently and for days at a time. I had bumps and irritation in the back of my throat. I even started getting tonsil stones. It literally felt like something is stuck in my throat all day every day. It is hard to be in a good mood when you feel like that. My quality of life was severely affected.
After visiting a new doctor I was prescribed pantoprazole and its been a world of difference since. I am in awe at how tired and painful I was before this treatment. Recently after almost a year of taking it daily I ran out of refills and didnt have a doctors appointment until a week later. I figured I could hold out until then, but that was a mistake. The days after my last dose were hell. I forgot about all the discomfort  and chest pain. I began to have difficulty swallowing and got body aches. I had hiccups all day again. My throat became tight. Its so crazy how GERD affects you. It is truly disabling and thankfully I was able to get a refill on my prescription just three days after. 
Just wanted to share that with this community and dismiss the idea that GERD is just really bad heartburn.

Ive been dealing with several symptoms lately and already did blood work, heart checks, brain scans and test for stomach and gut and everything came back normal.
My heart rate increases a lot by just standing and walking. Resting heart rate is between 60-70 and standing between 120-140.
I have stomach issues. Have to visit the bathroom 5 to 6 times a day. Sometimes its diarrhea but mostly loose stool.
I also have severe insomnia. Already taking sleeping pills but I can only sleep for 3 to 4 hours with them.
I have felt somewhat fatigued since November last year but since January its just gotten worse. Right now I cant even work from home anymore because I cant sit for 8 hours. When the fatigue is really bad  I can do nothing but lie down.
My husband got a wheelchair for me so we could go to doctors appointments because I cant walk much.
When I dont feel fatigued I feel jittery and have the urge to move even though I dont have much energy. 
I also sweat very easily but feel really cold when I go outside. 

Right now I spend most of the time lying down. Its hard to get done daily tasks like showering and eating.

391,rwtyaa,t5_2qlaa,"when PPIs don't work for hearburns
Hi,

I had H. Pylori eradication therapy (accidentally found) in July and got mild gastritis and NERD. My only symptom was a sore throat after the therapy. I was out on PPIs, but not on a strict diet (had to use garlic and VitC for severe Candida infection after the antibiotics). Then 3 months later my heartburns started, still no pain or anything, just heartburns throughout the day. I was at one point on 2x20mg rabeprazole which is the max dose and it didn't do anything, also tried with famotidine from which I had chest pain in the morning. The burns suddenly stopped after ditching H2 and PPIs (?), but after a few weeks returned a bit subtle than before but still present almost every day, probably cause I ate more ""dangerous"" meals and was put in more stressful situations. I have to mention I always got 1 (one) acid reflux episode when lowering or ditching PPIs, but not when I don't use them. Also, I feel nauseous and like my stomach doesn't work when on PPIs. The last gastroscopy showed again mild gastritis, no HP, and again prescribed 10mg of rabeprazole.

THE ONLY thing I found helpful is chewing food until it turns into liquid and my main symptoms are still heartburns and burping.

No smoking, no alcohol, no spicy and mostly avoiding dairy and fat.

The thing is I'm scared how do PPIs not stop heartburns and it makes me extremely anxious? I was also on Dexilant and Nexium but on short periods. Is longer chewing may be a sign I need digestive enzymes or is anxiety the main cause or do I have histamine intolerance? I'm using probiotics and IBS supplements at the moment.

High platelets, High MID%, Low MPV. He doesnt seem concerned about them since he hasnt reached out but I also dont trust that he looks at things until my next appointment is near? It also could mean nothing, I know Im not a doctor.

Fosamprenavir was deemed the lead candidate and subsequently tested in an in vivo model of LPR to assess its efficacy to abrogate pepsin-mediated laryngeal inflammation and damage.  Oral administration of fosamprenavir, 20mg/kg/day, equivalent to the FDA approved dose used to treat HIV in humans, prevented pepsin-mediated laryngeal damage.  Moreover, administration by inhalation at a lower dose of 1mg/kg/day, also prevented pepsin-mediated laryngeal injury.

Hi all, just as the title says; it feels like pills/tablets are getting stuck on the left side of my Adams apple.

Ill take my tablet or pill like I usually do and it feels like itll come back up after a few seconds and stay by my Adams apple.

405,ru2hex,t5_2s1h9,"Can absence seizures develop into grand mal?
  So I've been diagnosed with epilepsy for a little bit over 1 or 2 years now. I'm on keppra and clobazam but I don't think it helped much. I have no signs or evidence that it works nor does it not. Every appointment Ive had, the neurologist just increases the dosage and when it's at its highest possible dose, he adds another medicine. I feel my epilepsy remains untreated, but in the recent appointment (which was by call btw), my parents explained my condition pretty vaguely I must say, so I think my neurologist thinks that I'm improving by a long shot. Before you question why didn't I tell him, you gotta know I had online class at the same time, so I was only there for a bit over 2 minutes? and the rest were recorded bits of my parents and the neurologist talking. 

  So there were a few instances where I think I had grand mal. 1. You see, on my break after the first half of my classes, I went to the toilet to take a shit. But just as I was about to get out, I suddenly woke up on my bed, next to a bunch of paramedics and my parents. I was hella confused. Turns out I passed out in my toilet n my parents got me out. I was then sent to the hospital. 2. Another instance I suspect was a grand mal was when I was almost done with my tuition and then I vomited out of the blue and then again woke up on my bed. Apparently, my last memory then was that I vomited, but I wouldn't have remembered that if my parents didn't mention about the dirt on my bedroom floor. 3. This was the most recent and scariest one. So I was playing video games casually with my brother and cousin. I felt very relaxed and normal but then again, I woke up to a bunch of paramedics with medical supplies. This time my brother, cousin and parents witnessed my seizure. They said they thought I was just stretching my hand out at first, but then I started trembling and I was moving every part of my body all at once. This led to them thinking it was a prank until I stopped moving and fainted on the floor. Additionally, they said my eyes we're rolled all the way up and all they could see were the whites and the veins. At the hospital, all they did was contact my previous neurologist who was on a vacation so this lead me nowhere but to believe my condition is getting worse.  Recently, I've also developed some tremors, like when one of my legs shook so violently when I yawned. My mother saw that and told me to try doing it again, but j couldnt, it just happened subconsciously.

He said they were spreading lies to anyone they could also his work place. The story kept changing and he called them memories that were coming back to him.

410,s6yts3,t5_2s23e,"Dizziness and ear popping?
Hi all


So my issues with this MS journey all started with dizziness.

I was told I had MS after my first MRIs but now they are making me take more tests for a confirmed diagnosis. 

Just wondering if anyone has the same sensations? I'm not seeing many of these auto immune diseases with ear issues or dizziness. 

 Its hard to describe the dizziness I feel, and when I read other stories about people with MD  it seems like I'm having a  different sensation then what is typically reported

My sensation is more like a woozy feeling. It either feels like something is swimming through my brain, or like a head rush. Like being on an elevator. Its all internal, my surroundings don't spin or anything. It doesn't make me off balance,, its just a super uncomfortable feeling in my head. Makes me feel like my brain is broken. It was bad in October, became less frequent/strong until now, but hasn't really stopped.


Im also having ear popping problems. Like throughout the day my ears will pop or crack in my head. I was seeing an ENT Dr who had me doing sinus rinse for pastulous ear dysfunction but it doesn't seem to be working and she basically passed me off the the neurologist. Often times the dizziness and ear popping happen simultaneously.


Has anyone had either of these issues as I've described? 

Im just curious because the stuff I've found about dizzy online seems like more of a vertigo, and nobody seems to have ear popping issues.

Hello! And good day to you

Been dealing with gout for ~ 2 years now. On 200 mg allo. 

Just had some anecdotes to share and see if anyone had similar experiences

Like most, the worst attacks were in the beginning while starting allopurinol; Utterly debilitating and unable to walk. The intensity of the attacks went down over time, I usually am symptom free now for months at a time with an occasional mini flare. 

Some odd things Ive noticed:
-

- sometimes if I have/had an attack it will start in 1 part of 1 of my feet. It will then migrate around my foot then eventually subside and move to my other foot

426,p7gv0h,t5_2syer,"Found out a good alternative around exercising during a flare
To all active individuals afflicted by this dammed condition like me. I have found a way around keeping fit which works for me and I hope it does for you.

I am a 29 Y/O Male and do actively gym, run and swim when I unfortunately had my first flare last year. Since then, I have found ways around mitigating the limited mobility induced by each flare around the toe and ankle.

During the course of each flare up, I will tweak my exercise routine as per follows:

1) Upperbody routine still remains

2) Lower body, I mitigate inconveniences by placing focal  point on exercise that completely does not put any pressure or require the ankle/feet for stability (these exercises require you to push through with your shin)

 hamstring curls/leg raises machines and hyperextension in the gym - these exercises effectively hit your hamstring, quads and glutes

3) For Cardio, I substitute running/jogging with swimming, depending on the severity of the flare, I find that frog style( breast stroke) works best. If I am in a very bad flare where I have to limit mobility , my cardio sess would incorporate the use of a Pull buoy to limit all movements on my legs till the flare subside. Once the flare starts to subside, I will slowly low impact exercises to the joints such as swimming with the full body and short walks, giving myself at least 48-72hrs to rehab till I am able to do like short jogs.

Hope this helps any athletic individual who have been encountering setbacks from each flare through their exercise routine!

427,s52r4e,t5_2saq9,"Please share your beta blocker journeys!
Hi everyone, I'm not officially diagnosed with POTS but have dysautonomia symptoms similar to POTS. Honestly a little confused by all of it, seems like I have the tachycardia part but I also have some OH. Both are mild and my doctor said it wasn't worth it to do a tilt table test because her recommendation is the same either way (electrolytes, salt, probably a beta blocker). I have BAD heart palpitations so I am going to wear a heart monitor and see a cardiologist before starting on any medication. I also have severe headaches and migraines, so my primary care said I should probably be on a beta blocker either way.

I have tried propranolol in the past for migraine, and it worked so well for the migraines but it made my sleep really restless and unpleasant, so I discontinued. I have a hard time sleeping already so I'm really nervous about this side effect. Has anyone had experience taking a beta blocker for both tachycardia and headache? Or has anyone had to search around for a beta blocker that didn't disturb their sleep? I obviously will work closely with my doctors to pick the right drugs but I think I get some input on it so I was hoping to get some sense of what other peoples' experience is. Are there some that have more or less effects on sleep, or some that are better for headache? I also get random adrenaline surges at night, will a beta blocker help with that too?

I specially told them Im allergic to latex but they said there was no latex in the bandage, so whatever they used my skin did not like it. Otherwise, my muscles were just sore. It felt like I had pulled a pectoral muscle and slept wrong with my neck. My jaw was numb and I had severe gastric reflux. My throat was extremely uncomfortable because of the intubation. Had to sip whatever every few seconds. Went to work that day and was able to come off as normal.

Day 3: by this point my body realized that there was a foreign device in me and became swollen (trying to reject it a bit). The incision area was itchy not painful. I was able to do my normal workout at the gym - but not jumping exercises and was just a bit more tired because I was coming down from the drugs. Throat stopped hurting. 

Day 5: I removed the bandages on day 4 and let my skin get some air. At this point I was back to running and lifting, but jumping was challenging because Im a lady and we have a bit more on the chest   at this point I was able to sleep on both side comfortably.

Has anyone here tried breathing only through either their nose or throat, and has it affected anything for you?

I should've said that I first encountered this idea over a year ago via Joe Rogan and other people he's interviewed, as well as someone called Wim Hof who talked about deep breathing excercises. I would say the latter have helped a little at times, but I've also been basically only breathing through my nose since then and I'm just slowly getting worse in terms of the GERD so idk.

All of a sudden I dont need the laxatives and I can go with just half a cup of coffee. No diarrhea but normal stools. During this week I had to add 1/3 of the normal dose of laxatives and a cup of coffee to go.

I've been battling GERD due to taking too much ibuprofen & antibiotics and wanted to share my journey to help anyone else in the future who has to go through what I did since I've noticed there aren't many posts on GERD that is caused by medication. I am very healthy, never ate poorly, 24 year old female, 5'6, \~120 lbs.

&#x200B;

**Symptoms:** 

Initially: Nausea, Anxiety, Heart Palpitations, Heart Fluttering, Left Upper Arm Pain, Left Armpit Pain, Sharp pain under left breast (top ribcage left side), Burping, Acid in back of throat, waking up in the middle of the night in a panic

1 month later: Left Upper Arm Pain, Left Armpit Pain, Sharp pain under left breast (top ribcage left side), Burping, Acid in back of throat, Muscle spasms all over the body, Back Pain upper left area, Right side chest pain, Sternum pain

Medications I'm taking: I was taking Spironolactone and stopped 3 weeks ago, now I am only on oral birth control pills & nothing else. I tried over-the-counter omeprazole 20mg for 1 day and had the WORST side effects, my left wrists were hurting, super intense stomach pains all day & heart skipping a beat for 24 hours so I decided I was not going to take it anymore. 

**What has helped:** 

\- I am on the acid reflux diet for almost a month now! You can google this and basically I eat all the foods on the diet that I know won't cause me heartburn. Even some foods on the acid reflux diet have caused my heartburn to be severe, so it's trial and error for everyone, however what worked for me was, rice, ground turkey 99% lean, dairy/yogurt ONLY 0% FAT, root vegetables (beets, potato, sweet potato), super lean chicken, oatmeal, blueberries, raspberries, blackberries, cucumbers, multigrain bread etc. I eliminated pretty much everything that you're not supposed to eat and have not cheated once, since I do not want to have any flare ups! 

\- Sleeping on an elevation with 2 pillows, helped me not wake up with a sore throat / acid taste

\- Sleeping on my left side, not sure why this helps, but I've noticed it does tremendously 

\- Drinking a lot of water throughout the day & chamomile tea

**Next Steps:**

I have an appointment with a Gastroenterologist in about 2 weeks and I will update to see if I will need to get an endoscopy or my treatment plan!

**Overall:**

I am feeling much better than I have this past month, where I was in chronic pain, heart wouldn't stop beating out of my chest, chest pains, and although I still have these pains, they are less severe than they were and I am thinking it is due to my eating habits & lifestyle changes.

Hi All, 

I've been battling GERD due to taking too much ibuprofen & antibiotics and wanted to share my journey to help anyone else in the future who has to go through what I did since I've noticed there aren't many posts on GERD that is caused by medication. I am very healthy, never ate poorly, 24 year old female, 5'6, \~120 lbs.

&#x200B;

**Symptoms:** 

Initially: Nausea, Anxiety, Heart Palpitations, Heart Fluttering, Left Upper Arm Pain, Left Armpit Pain, Sharp pain under left breast (top ribcage left side), Burping, Acid in back of throat, waking up in the middle of the night in a panic

1 month later: Left Upper Arm Pain, Left Armpit Pain, Sharp pain under left breast (top ribcage left side), Burping, Acid in back of throat, Muscle spasms all over the body, Back Pain upper left area, Right side chest pain, Sternum pain

Medications I'm taking: I was taking Spironolactone and stopped 3 weeks ago, now I am only on oral birth control pills & nothing else. I tried over-the-counter omeprazole 20mg for 1 day and had the WORST side effects, my left wrists were hurting, super intense stomach pains all day & heart skipping a beat for 24 hours so I decided I was not going to take it anymore. 

**What has helped:** 

\- I am on the acid reflux diet for almost a month now! You can google this and basically I eat all the foods on the diet that I know won't cause me heartburn. Even some foods on the acid reflux diet have caused my heartburn to be severe, so it's trial and error for everyone, however what worked for me was, rice, ground turkey 99% lean, dairy/yogurt ONLY 0% FAT, root vegetables (beets, potato, sweet potato), super lean chicken, oatmeal, blueberries, raspberries, blackberries, cucumbers, multigrain bread etc. I eliminated pretty much everything that you're not supposed to eat and have not cheated once, since I do not want to have any flare ups! 

\- Sleeping on an elevation with 2 pillows, helped me not wake up with a sore throat / acid taste

\- Sleeping on my left side, not sure why this helps, but I've noticed it does tremendously

478,ruwxja,t5_2s1h9,"2 seizures a week apart or so
 

So I was drunk one night and apparently I hit my head. This was end of november like the 29th maybe. I don't think I blacked out. My head wasn't even sore the next day I didn't even know that I had hit my head till like 2 weeks ago buddy was like maybe you hitting your head at my place has something to do with your seizures. I had a concussion like 6 years ago was drunk and I fell on pavement, my head was sore for 2 days. But this time my head wasn't even sore and don't remember falling even. 

anyways the first seizure happened at my men's league hockey game dec 12th I think. (Games are Sunday nights only) I was fine all game playing how I usually do, actually felt like I had alot of energy that game actually.All of a sudden I went to reach for the puck no one was near me I froze couldn't control my body fell on my back massive headache for a second or 2, but as soon as I hit the ice I passed out. Apparently I was shaking, convulsing from my mouth, hands were blue from lack of oxygen and I was unresponsive. I was out for 5minutes I woke up and paramedics were already there to take me on a stretcher they asked me questions like where I was, what time was my game, where I worked. I remembered everything before passing out was totally fine before that incident. I was having fun I enjoy hockey and exercising. I got to the er I got my blood checked in so many spots, blood pressure taken a bunch of times, mri or ct scan I got done. Was sent home they didn't know what was wrong they just said I could of passed out. After that first siezure I was really tired but it also was like 2am by the time I got out of there.

I went to work the next day (carpenter), would have times of the day where I was slightly dizzy, definitely didn't have my 100% balance or hand eye, or memory. Was like that all week. I didn't have to wear my mask at work but I went grocery shopping on the weekend and I found it extremely uncomfortable wearing a mask I definitely wasn't getting 100% oxygen or something. I work mon-fri, so I decided to go to the gym Saturday. I was working out my upper body and 10 minutes in maybe I noticed I was slightly dizzy I kept going it slowly got worse than after 30mins it was pretty bad almost fell like I really could have lost my balance. So I left ,drove home slowly got less dizzy was fine enough to drive. Doctor hadn't said I couldn't drive at this point said I was fine. I decided not to go to hockey on Sunday the week after dec 19th because I wasn't 100% even though I was allowed to play doctor didn't say I couldn't. 

I went to see a cardiologist on the 20th (monday) got x-rays done eeg and had to wear a heart monitor for 2 days. 

I worked the next 2 days tues - wed. Was off Thursday I slept in decided not to go to the gym take it easy watched TV most of the day around 4pm I decided to go in the basement grab my hockey stick and play around with a ball. I got a little dizzy at the start but it wasn't as bad as when I was at the gym the other day so I kept going. After about 10minutes in my body locked up I was shaking a bit I knew it was happening again, I wanted to kneel down but I had no control over my body. Then I eventually fell face first on the ground my right shoulder and just above my nose is what I hit first on cement floor. I woke up in my bed which was up 2 floors wondering what the fuck I was doing in my bed at around 5pm with shoulder pain. After about a good 2minutes of being confused wondering why I was laying in my bed I remembered I had a seizurein the basement. (these times aren't accurate I never really looked at the time when this happened) I don't remember getting up off the basement floor. Last thing I remembered is falling on my face then waking up in my bed. I called my mother and said I had another seizure then I got in my car and drove to the hospital which was 2minutes away. They checked my blood and everything again same as the first time, only thing that was different is they said my electrolytes or something was abit low so they gave me something that tasted kind of like Gatorade. The doctor said I should take anti seizure pills and stay away from driving. 

The cardiologist gave me the results and said nothing was wrong except they noticed a small cyst in my spleen said it was probably nothing and was gonna check on it in 3months . Ever since the first seizure I have about 80% of my energy, memory hand eye and balance. Ever since I started taking 2 anti seizure pills a day I have noticed I haven't been dizzy at all and wearing a mask (lack of oxygen) wasn't as bad as I went to the grocery store after my first seizure. Today jan 3 I've noticed armpit odor, knee pain, I get flashes on chest pain more to my right side. Ive got Flashes of headaches but not for a couple days.

I've noticed that In person when trying to explain myself or just talking I space out wander off and forget what I was talking about, stutter frequently which I always have problems with but I noticed it's a bit worse since the first seizure. I have adhd or something I'm very quiet frequent depression and mental health problems. I quit smoking weed 17 months ago and I've barely had any alcohol this year and I actually haven't had any since My maybe concussion incident november 28th. I've started to be more open about my mental health problems since maybe the start of December told my family friends and even talked online to a therapist a cpl days a week which made me feel so much better as I used to always try to hide everything. 

I told my captain of my hockey team I'm not playing for the rest of the season since I haven't felt fully 100% since my first seizure even though I'm allowed to play. After my 2nd seizure I was told I only couldn't drive, swim, climb, operate machinery or work at heights.

I'm going to see a neurologist on the 19th 

The doctors still don't know why the seizures happened and I'm dying of curiosity of what's wrong with me lol, I go for walks to keep active as well as ice fishing( I've been off work since like dec 23rd). I start back work tomorrow if I get a doctor's note. If you actually read this whole thing your a fucking beauty lol. Like I said I'm dying of curiosity, should I play hockey soon or lightwork out at the gym soon? How long will i not be able to drive? 

Mainly what is wrong with me??? lol

479,rwldz4,t5_2s1h9,"My boyfriend has generalized epilepsy w/grand mal. He struggles to find and maintain employment. Aid in PA?
Hey guys, I'm hoping for some advice or stories here. 

My boyfriend was diagnosed at ~15 years old and is now 23. I am 22 and bought a house across the country. We are looking to move there, but I cannot solely provide for him should he be unable to find employment. 

COVID has been hard enough on job opportunities, but he has over a year gap in his resume and has been working part time retail jobs more recently. However, he feels like he might have a seizure now and then and this means he leaves work early. I fear they are cutting his hours because they don't see him as reliable. 

He's only had about one grand mal seizure every ~3 months, and that's because he listens to his body and rests when he needs to. 

Because of this, it looks like he doesn't qualify for federal disability benefits. They're not frequent enough, but his employers will continue to fire/cut hours until he's basically shadow-fired. 

What programs are there to help find employment? He's interested in IT, working from home at any capacity, or anything without too much physical labor. 

Are there any programs to give him a disability status that can be used to leverage more sick days at work?

If so, does it completely bar him from holding a driver's license? His seizures are well managed, but the dosages/meds he has needs tweaking since weight gain. He has gone almost a year before without seizures when he was thinner, so I'm hoping we can try and keep his rights to a license.

481,rxxzpu,t5_2syer,"Diet and tests
I have a few questions for everyone. It seems like this is a very active group so I haven't had time to ready everything. So please point me in the right direction if my questions have already been answered.

Background

I am a 23 year old male weighing 295 lbs. When I had my first attack I was 260. During my most recent attack I was 340. I have been suffering from gout since 2018. When I had my first official uric acid test in June of 2019 I was at 9.7. At that time my doctor told me to lose weight and change my diet. I did not receive any medications to control the flares. From November of 2020 to February of 2021 I suffered from multiple and severe attacks in both feet. I finally started 100 mg of allopurinol in April/May of 2021. In June of 2021 I was tested again and I was at a 10.1. At that point I received 300mg of allopurinol. I have not had an attack since then but I just went in to check my levels and I was still at an 8.0. Which is still high, right? I have even lost weigt since my last attacks! I have been on top of taking my medicine, staying hydrated, and I stay away from alcohol, red meat (other than 6-8oz of chicken), sugar, and seafood. So what am I doing wrong?? My doctor is going to raise me to 500mg of allopurinol and test again in about a month or 2. I want to eventually eat red meat again and have a few drinks. Which leads me to my questions. 

Questions

1. After starting the 500mg of allopurinol should I start eating red meat, within reason, before my next test? That way I can see if my levels are high with the addition of my love, red meat. Beacsue I think that would give me the possibility of a higher dose so I can eat red meat, right? 

2. I have looked into some at home uric acid tests and I would love to monitor my levels at home. Has anyone had any luck with at home tests? I would like to figure out my triggers and this seams like a easy way to do it. I would love recommendations on good and bad brands. 

3. If my levels are still high on 500mg I would like to switch or take multiple medications to control it. Does anyone have recommendations on what medicine worked best for them? Or do you take more than one medication to help uric acid levels? 

4. I have heard gin is the best alcohol for gout sufferers. Mainly because if the juniper berries. Anyone have luck with gin or another alcohol? 

5. I want to lose weight by exercising but a lot of people say that raises the chance if a gout attack? Do any of you know that to be true. I can't be 295 forever. I'm 23 and need to get healthy. 

Final statement

I would really like to go back to a normal life of red meat and occasionally having a drink or two. I would really like to know if the at home tests are worth looking into. I would also love to hear your opinions on eating red meat, within reason, before my test.

But I wonder whether I should really do this if I am not in the midst of a flare up (of whatever it is I have). Because that's when blood tests would turn out with important information, right? 

The thing is, in the last year I have noticed that I sometimes just randomly (or not so randomly, maybe it is stress-related, too) get a low-grade fever (my body temperature is generally low, but I recently get days where it rises from 96.9 to 98.6). When this happens I also feel extremely fatigued, like I am going to get sick with the flu, my body feels heavy and aches. And my chest hurts sharply when I inhale. This has also happened occassionally. 

Soo, I wondered, at what point did you make an appointment with a rheumatologist? When did you say, well, this is not normal and weird?

Hi.

Wondering if I have POTS.  Here's my story:

I have Sjogren's.  If I'm standing, I want to be sitting.  (Walking is okay though.) When sitting, it seems effortful to get up and cross the room. Thought this was Sjogren's fatigue but maybe it's POTS?  Tried home standing test.  71 bpm supine, and the +2 minute, 5 minute, 10 minute standing values were 95, 100, 106.  

Taking showers has always left me tired/drained, going back 25 years at least.

On a recent plane trip I had waves of fatigue followed by heavy sweating, over and over again.

I made an appt to talk to my PCP about this.  Any advice?

Second question:  I'm scheduled to take a plane to a 6000-ft elevation for a week-long conference.  Good idea?

500,p7j49y,t5_2syer,"Crazy amount of sardines caused gout (possibly cured?)
Hello! Throughout the last 1.5 years I've been eating maybe 2 cans of sardines a day on average. I realize this sounds crazy but almost everything I read showed that sardines are like salmon but without the mercury and there were even articles saying daily consumption of sardines is safe. A few months ago I had a minor gout attack (very small amount of pain) and didn't realize what it was. Then I had a much worse one 2 months later, realized what it was, went on NSAIDS etc. The pain went away almost immediately from NSAIDs, literally in 10h maybe (at least it went to 1% of what it was) the swelling went down but stayed a bit and never really went away. A few weeks later I went to the beach, had some champagne and lobster (I had read lobster wasn't so high in purines, less than chicken) [https://elevatehealthaz.com/wp-content/Purine%20Table.pdf](https://elevatehealthaz.com/wp-content/Purine%20Table.pdf) and hoped that this wouldn't do anything. I also went on a hike the next day. The day after that I got another gout attack (worse than first, not as bad as second). 

I have totally cut out sardines and pretty much all meat from my diet, I've never really had any sugar in my diet except through fruit, I follow a very strict diet 99% of the time (except when celebrating). Pretty much just oatmeal, eggs, kale, avocados, etc). 

I have read that gout can't be cured, that it's caused by a number of factors outside of diet including kidneys unable to flush uric acid quickly enough, enzymes in body from genetics producing too much uric acid, autoimmune and inflammation issues etc. I have had my kidneys tested and they flush uric acid at a normal rate, I have had my chronic inflammation levels tested (through c reactive protein liver tests) and it is normal as well. I also have had my uric acid tested at 7.9 (months after cutting out sardines). 

It seems completely reasonable that gout could be caused temporarily by a huge amount of purines and uric acid (like if you injected yourself with uric acid and got your rate to 20 or 30 for example, physically it seems like it would ALWAYS crystalize at high enough levels. For this reason (not necessarily arguing that it's true in my case) it seems like gout could be cured in some cases by lowering uric acid levels (only in people who would never get it normally and had some action that caused a huge amount of abnormal build up like eating 2-3 cans of sardines a day). 

However, I have not read anything about gout being ""cured"" and this sub seems to mainly say that diet actually has a limited impact and rarely helps (most people seem to recommend allopurinol). I totally understand this, for many people gout is caused by the factors I mentioned above, not changed by diet, but it seems reasonable that crazy diets could cause temporary gout, cured through the normalization of that diet.

Hey guys. Ive had ibs-mixed for years. Ive taken other brands of probiotics in the past and never had the intensive shits Im having w doctors recipe womens probiotics. Its only been a week and Im assuming that my gut was severely out of whack because of my ibs so itll take time to normalize. But I take it with or directly after food as instructed and within like 15 mins I get the gurgle and run to the toilet. *this is descriptive fair warning* the poo is very mucousy and I can see some small floaties and swirls of particles. Now Im not new to this type of pop but it typically only happens when Im very stressed. My poos are never pretty but even tho its always diarrhea its not always my stomach is doing cartwheels and Im sprinting. 

I wasnt sure if this was an immediate I should stop or just give it another week. I have been appreciating how my poos are very timely. Like Ik within the next 15 mins I will poo and get allllll that gas burst out. So I know throughout the day Im safe from another aggressive one.

Hello! I'm 23 and have been having some myoclonic seizures. My doctor prescribed me 100mg of Keppra for this to see if it'd help. So far it's been helpful in that regard.

Hey guys. 

Wondering if anyone has had a similar symptom because of possible constipation. 
I was on a medication for 5/6 months that could cause constipation and during that time I randomly had a huge stabbing pain one night in my right lower quadrant. I couldnt stand, bend over, walk for a few hours. Anytime I moved the pain radiated in my right hip area and a little behind my hip/ lower back just by the hip. I thought my appendix burst but I decided to wait it out. I ended up using the bathroom and I felt better hours after that but the aching feeling took a day or two to completely go away. 
Its been over a year since that occurred and the pain sometimes comes and goes. Its never been as bad as it was the first time but I can still feel it sort of ache. Sometimes when it happens I can feel it get irritated if my jeans are too tight and if Im sitting/I bend my right leg up to my chest only on the right side in this one spot. 
My doctor doesnt think its my appendix & said trust me youd know if your appendix burst. He also felt in the area during my annual visit and there was no pain there, therefore he ruled out it being anything but constipation pains. 
Im wondering if I should make an appointment and recheck the area.

Hi there! 

Sorry for the long story:

After 4 years of struggle, I was finally diagnosed with hiatus hernia (grade A) and esofagitis. I also have a horrible cough that has been going on for the past 3 years and has been happening increasingly more often, to the point where now it's almost every day. I'm scared of being stuck with any permanent damage to my throat or lungs..

Basically it all started 4 years ago with my heart fluttering/beating hard after every meal. I was prescribed xanax without even having checked my heart.. even though i never had any anxiety problems. For 6 months I took xanax and had the same symptoms, so all the doctors told me to 'just chill, you're stressing too much'. Then a cough started, always at night, lasting between 1-3 hours, i thought it was the smoking so i reduced the cigarettes but it still happened. The doctor did an xray said my lungs are fine and just to stop smoking, but even stopping smoking didn't fix it. It used to happen every few months, then every month, and now every week, almost every single day for the past 10 days. 

The pills don't work, the diet doesn't work, I'm just losing hope in everything, and everything my doctor can say is well, you just have to take omeprazol twice a day for the rest of your life. I'm 31, I don't want to take any pills every day for the rest of my life, especially not one that can damage my kidneys or cause osteoporosis. 

I'm down to a very light decaf coffee a day with a lot of no dairy milk, I'm staying away from sweets such as chocolate, fried and greasy foods. I took omeprazol for the past 3 months, with little to no relief. I quit it for 2 weeks and immediately felt better, only for it to start again right after the endoscopy, so now i'm back on it. 

If you have any tips, any tips at all for living with this or making it more bearable, please do share, because I feel like i'm going up the walls, like I'm only a shell of myself. How do you deal with this?

Sorry but I've recently been walking everyday for my arthritis and fibro, and noticed when I sit down and chill after, I get a tight and weak chest and my back and chest and ribs ache (basically my whole body aches) and I get tired and slightly dizzy. I have tachycardia and take two beta blockers in the morning and again at night.

Then I just feel completely pooped and have to lie down while my body aches. It helps my overall pain and energy and stiffness throughout the day but this bit is always so annoying.

525,rs3587,t5_2s1h9,"I'm losing my mind. Do I go to the neuro or the Psych???
TL;DR: Epilepsy since 7/21. On trileptal. Also have ADHD. My emotional outbursts/episodes/panic attacks have increased and become severe. Also all ADHD symptoms are multiplied by 100. Exec function, memory, attentiveness... nonexistent. To the point of affecting life. Does my neuro or psych help first?? (I have upcoming appointments with both)


I have pretty severe ADHD (34, F). I have been diagnosed my entire life. I have been able to manage myself VERY well my entire adult life without medication. Even with my career. I do have sensory and mood issues too, but I have been great at managing them and realizing what's triggers them. 

I had my first and only nocturnal TC seizure 7/27/21. With like 10 days prior to that where I woke up insanely sweaty and nauseous and out of it (my neuro said it's likely I had a lot of partial seizures). I am immediately put on Oxcarbazapine (trileptal) because of the number of events I had. I do have recurring partial seizures/auras monthly still.

Here is what's happening to me. 

Since seizure and starting trileptal, my mood and emotional state were the first thing I noticed. I would get overstimulated way easier and it would put me into severe crying episodes, couldn't stop myself, and had to call into work. I would start off irritated, it would turn to almost rage, then into bawling. They happened a couple days, then I felt normal for a while. Now I have noticed that it happens just periodically. If I had to estimate, maybe 3-4 days a month? I also feel exhausted the next day after this. 

Last night, it happened again after a very minor argument with my husband. Irritated first from being overstimulated, then a short rage where I said ""just shut up""to him. This is a big deal because I've NEVER said ""shut up"" to him, ever, in 6 years. Then I snapped out of the anger, got scared that I acted like that, and had a severe panicking cry episode. It made me write this. 

 Memory is SO bad I am even having trouble remembering if I took my trileptal after I have had it in my hand. Or, my pill alarm goes off, I'm busy, I have forgotten within 5 minutes until the second alarm goes off. I have 3 alarms and still take them late sometimes. This is the easiest example, but the memory is SO BAD I can't even think of any more examples at the moment. 

Getting interrupted when I am focused on something is usually a minor inconvenience, but now, it's like I am completely thrown off and am lost. Like a child.  My husband asked me ""I thought you were going to do ___"" And it threw off my imagined ""routine"" so bad that whatever focus I had on cleaning was gone and I was instantly lost, recalculating, bit failing to get back on track. 

Last- overstimulation. Crowds used to be just uncomfortable for me. Now I can't hardly be in them. Lights hurt, sounds are amplified, anxiety skyrockets. Textures bother me more than before. Severely. Basically, all the things that ""bothered"" me before are amplified and make me want to crawl out of my skin. 

Writing this out, I feel so ridiculous, but I am hoping someone out there understands what I'm trying to say and maybe it resonates with them too. This has all been since my seizure.

526,pqt495,t5_2r876,"Long-term effects of abstaining or dialing-down albuterol usge
First off, this is just a today thing, and I am not advocating anything or saying anything is a good idea (because it seems suspect) or a bad one (because we've all experimented and I don't know and don't want anyone feeling judged)

I have what I consider to be low lung function ( 35-40, keenly aware it gets worse ) and after getting access to modulators, I reduced the frequency of breathing treatments. Pulmozyme because I bled if I took it once the mucus was gone, but also albuterol because I didn't always feel better breathing-wise, but I couldn't remember not being assigned to take it -- and it's incontrovertibly clear that there's a temporary boost to PFT numbers for me.

Trikafta especially because I after long enough on Orkambi, as my disease progressed I was up to 5 and 6 treatments just to feel normal -- literally eyeing the clock thinking ""this sucks, surely it's time to go again"" and seeing two hours to go before I was allowed to (I was told not to be any closer than every four hours and if I broke the rule my body seemed like it ""wanted it more""...not as an addiction but more like a reflex, going off the feelings in my throat and lungs).

After Trikafta I have usually only done three a day on average. Which is fucking awesome. As most of you know, even if you can walk around there's a de facto tether on you when you can't travel too far without knowing you gotta hook up to something in a little bit. It's almost the best part because of the freedom.

Lately, though, the nebs don't seem to help the *feeling* breathing-wise at *all* and I am getting concerned that no matter the machine, no matter the cups, no matter the power or the cleaning process, I don't feel better using them and sometimes feel worse.

I am making a ...trial choice (under supervision) to see how long I can not take them, but as a hypothetical (and I couldn't get an answer on this) I wasn't sure how much of albuterol use was long-term maintenance for us.

Which is to say, even if you felt fucking amazing and had two or three times my FEV1s, should you still be taking it to...I don't know, like, keep the airways as open as possible whenever possible? Can they be trained or adapt?

Could I be doing myself a disservice and somehow making them weaker without the assist -- with respect to any particular started FEV or capacity, not my individual situation.

I have accidentally had to go about a full day and it was not lovely but I would have thought it would have been more of a drag. 

And the stubborn part of me feels that if I could go just a bit longer....I know it's bad to do things to 'prove something to yoursef' when you health is involved, but it's easy to switch back to what I am used to....but that it'd be the final step in feeling like a non-CFer after I've received the blessings of the rest of it (I obviously feel loads worse than a truly healthy person but I mean in relative experience)",claim_per_exp,"Trikafta especially because I after long enough on Orkambi, as my disease progressed I was up to 5 and 6 treatments just to feel normal -- literally eyeing the clock thinking",749,923,174,"(FRAG (NP (NNP Trikafta)) (SBAR (ADVP (RB especially)) (IN because) (S (NP (PRP I)) (PP (IN after) (NP (NP (ADJP (JJ long) (RB enough))) (PP (IN on) (NP (NNP Orkambi))))) (, ,) (SBAR (IN as) (S (NP (PRP$ my) (NN disease)) (VP (VBD progressed)))) (NP (PRP I)) (VP (VBD was) (NP (QP (IN up) (IN to) (CD 5) (CC and) (CD 6)) (NNS treatments)) (ADVP (RB just)) (VP (VP (TO to) (VP (VB feel) (ADJP (JJ normal)))) (: --) (S (ADVP (RB literally)) (VP (VBG eyeing) (NP (DT the) (NN clock)) (S (VP (VBG thinking))))))))))",FRAG,0

So I figured I might get some answers here, apologies in advance for the long post but if anyone can help it could literally change my life. 

My symptoms are more or less diarrhea 1 or 2 times a day, often feel cramping before it happens (not after Ive eaten the food but just before I go to the toilet). I dont need to run to the toilet, but when I do go if often takes 20 mins to get through it and it burns for hours after. 

My doctor took blood and stool samples, nothing showed up so they told me to go to a website and find which foods I can digest and said its probably IBS and that was that. 

Instead I went to a private dietician/professional and he tested me for intolerances to which I only had lactose - something I had already figured and more or less cut out my diet. He showed me the low fodmap diet which I paired with probiotics which definitely seemed to help a bit and then after reintroducing different foods Ive been on and off with the IBS triggers. 

But even now when I feel like Im eating fairly strict I can have times where Im still going through it for days. Then I can get a few good days where I have no issues but the bad days always come back. Its like everything just triggers, and I keep going round in circles in my mind as to what it could be but its hard to track. 

For example Indian food always gave me a bad stomach without fail (again felt fine after eating but next morning was guaranteed to be bad), 2 weeks ago I tried it without any curry sauce (starters only) and my stomach next day was great. Last night I had the exact same from the same place and my stomach today has been really bad. I dont know where to turn. I go to the gym 4-5 times a week as it helps my mental health and I need to eat properly to support that lifestyle, but my god its getting hard. 

I dont know if its 100% IBS having seen other posts on here but perhaps if someone has similar symptoms you may have an answer for me. Maybe I just need to be super strict 100% or face the consequences, maybe its something else entirely. I do feel there is a natural cure for almost anything and I wish there was someone to help me and everyone else suffering with it.",claim_per_exp,"But even now when I feel like Im eating fairly strict I can have times where Im still going through it for days.

542,suytct,t5_2s3g1,"Don't know how to interpret my gastrointestinal symptoms
 30M, no health conditions. Normal weight, regular exercise and generally eat well

Last  summer I've had periods of constipation, seen a gastro doc and after  some tests he said it's just IBS and nothing to worry about. Since then  I've been fine until November.

I've  been having episodes of gastro symptoms since November. Before that I  was suffering from insomnia and lost a friend of mine to cancer. So I  was severely depressed and stressed during that period. It first began  as constipation that lasted about a week. I increased my fiber intake  and managed my sleeping and the constipation has resolved within 2  weeks. But then I've started to experience bloating after meals. No pain  but just bloating. My GP recommended I should take Spasmo(Otilonium  bromide) so I did take it for 2 weeks. I don't know if it's placebo but  it really helped and I experienced less bloating during that period. I  quit using it after 2 weeks and since then was symptom free. I improved  my mood as well. However lately I've began to experience it again  despite having no stressors in my life. Lately I've been having hard  stools, bloating, feeling full long after meals. It's been about a week.  Bloating subsides after a few hours but returns after eating.

My  stools are normal in color and shape(other than being slightly  constipated). No pain, no fever, no juandice or any other symptoms  whatsoever. Just bloating, hard stools and feeling full longer than  usual. I don't know what to do since I can't tell if it's just normal  due to constipation or sign of something serious that I should visit a GI doc.

543,sa3idk,t5_2tyg2,"Relationship issue with psychosis :( Is it over? Is there hope?
I don't know where to start.

I was the one suffering from intermittent psychosis, but with meds I haven't had a real episode in about 2 years. Then I met my boyfriend.

He started using meth really early in the relationship. He said it was the only thing that he could get his hands on because he for some reason, couldnt get his adderall prescription anymore. The meth made him really paranoid at first, and then it wore off and he just became kinda fixated on his computer for like 8 months.

Then his mom committed suicide and he, well... it was the perfect setup for psychosis. The voices began, the paranoid delusions about police and the government and cyber stalking. Then he started accusing my parents of trying to get me to leave him. The voices he heard were those of my parents. He called the police multiple times at night for various reasons ranging from 'I smelled smoke' to ""they need to just put me in jail."". The police stopped responding to his calls.

He just kept using. And god I tried to get him to stop, but after he tried to quit for about 2 months, he was the worst most awful person to be around during detox. He broke and started using, the delusions came back stronger, and he got sent to the hospital once, discharged, and then another time, got into inpatient, and then discharged like 3 days later, not having learned a thing.

I knew when he came home from inpatient that things weren't exactly gucci. He was googling the names of the doctors in the unit at the hospital and mumbling about them. He uncovered a lot of standard personal information about the doctors and went full conspiracy about how they were unqualified, etc. Just because one doctor had a soundcloud account, lol.

He started using again (AHH) and his psychotic episodes started to become verbally abusive towards me. Less rambling to himself and more accusational about me and my intentions. He still firmly believes that I myself requested a court order for him to go to inpatient and that turned into me trying to steal his organs.

We had to move to his dad's house and it just got so much worse. He does the following now:

Stands and stares in a general direction for literally LITERALLY hours.

Goes on tirades about certain subjects such as: Eugenics, how everyone on earth is a bastard of Henry Ford or George Washington, his disgust of southerners and I guess(??) the fishing community?, and a common one is how he thinks the house was built on the graves of the founding fathers and ALSO that ties in with the local grocery store using people as meat rather than animals. Oh, and I'm also the Sandy Hook shooter... And i'm also behind all of these conspiracies.

Sit on his computer and look at the Google search engine and just laugh hysterically.

He can't take any direction and refuses to help out around the house.

He also 'broke up with me' yesterday in the middle of an episode, and said the worst most hurtful things about me, and left me crying. It's so hard taking care of him and being his advocate. Now I'm nothing to him and he laughs when I cry. He wont stop using meth and I swear if he wasn't, he would probably have never broken up with me.

Another thing: He absolutely refuses to be self-aware about ANY of this and will never admit he heard voices, that he has ever had psychotic episodes, and he says that ""If you feel hurt by something I said, but I didn't mean to hurt you, then I don't believe you're hurt."" He blames all of it on anxiety and 'confusion', and regularly in the middle of episodes states the date, where he is, the time, the president, and who is around him as to 'prove' he isnt in psychosis.  


The meth has got to stop. But how long does this last? When will he become functioning again? Should I even stay in this relationship to see it through at this point? He is being so incredibly selfish after I have been through a year of hell being his caretaker so he can get high. I just don't know what to do. I wish the guy I knew came back.

548,ozw25v,t5_2syer,"I made gout soup today!
As a scientist and gout sufferer, I wanted to combine high anti-inflammatory and uric acid lowering foods in a soup. I started with the essential ingredients with scientific proven benefits and during the making I added extra super-healthy ingredients to the soup. I am a vegetarian since I suffer from gout, so no meat will be used in this recipe.

***Important note***:I do believe in the power of healthy food, as they contain active compounds, which have been proven to have real health benefits. However, I want to make clear that this recipe is NOT a substitute for gout medication. Allopurinol is a powerful drug which can bring your uric acid serum levels down, and colchicine is a great alkaloid to stop or reduce the pain of a gout attack. This soup may help your gout but this recipe is especially just a very healthy soup with ingredients that may lower uric acid levels and may have anti-inflammatory effects. Effects are proven in vitro or in vivo and not always in humans. I just wanted to do this as a little experiment for fun.

Base ingredients:

* 600 grams of celery root
* 400 grams of celery
* 10 grams of turmeric
* 10 grams of curry powder
* 5 grams of black pepper
* One ginger root
* Two cloves of garlic
* 2,5 liters of water
* 30 mL of sunflower oil for sautéing

\*\*Method (Part I)\*\*I heated the oil in a large pot, added garlic, ginger and spices to the mix and sautéd for a short period. I then added cubes of celery root, pieces of celery to the pot. After few minutes of sautéing, I added the 2,5 liters of water. I cooked to a broth for nearly 45 minutes.

**Taste test**Not really yummy as expected, so I started improvising and added a few ingredients:

* More pepper, curry powder, salt and 8 bay laurel leaves
* About 5 to 8 grams of cayenne pepper: the spiciness gives a psychological detox feel :)
* 450 grams of broccoli (frozen)

Hey there r/gout,

I'm coming out of my first gout bout and have some questions. For context, I'm a healthy, 35 year old male whose father suffered from gout but my diet is not as meat-rich as his. In fact, since moving in with my fiancée 16 months ago I've been eating vegetarian 3-4 days/week. I do like beer, however. This flare up occurred in my right big toe but at times felt like the whole foot was under attack.

My nurse practitioner (who also happens to be my fiancée) said she's hesitant to start me on something lifelong just yet until we know more about the uric acid levels and flare-up frequencies; I have bloodwork schedule for next week. So my questions to veteran gout sufferers are:

* What do you use for uric acid monitoring?
* Any over-the-counter pills you recommend for damage control?
* I'm in the midst of a 12-week toenail fungal treatmentcould there be a link to gout here?

553,rdulqb,t5_2s1h9,"Alone, Anxious and Angry, full of FOMOI just want to talk to someone who understands.
I have had seizures my whole life, they originally thought it was only febrile seizures when I was young the rest of my grand mals were spread out enough that nobody ever really investigated and I never got an official epilepsy diagnosis because the tests they did when I was little came back fine. Looking back, my family and I are pretty sure that I had absence seizures frequently, but nobody really caught on something was up until I was in high school. At that point they just thought I was disassociating due to my ADHD/PTSD or the terrible migraines I experienced. In 2019 after a bad grand mal, I did get a diagnosis of focal polymicrogyria, nodules and extra brain liquid? (Idk what to call that) in my brain/skull. Now Docs believe this is the cause of my chronic migraines and seizures but cant prove it because all the EEGs Ive taken were clean  Recently the seizures have gotten bad, in September I had a grand mal at work and since had multiple seizures (not full tonic clonics just short absence seizures) a week, and migraines almost every day. Im working on going to an EMU at Keck but insurance hasnt approved it yet. In the meantime I feel like Im in limbo. My whole life is upended. Losing so much autonomy, and havent been able to work, to anxious to go out. My doctors wont approve me for SDI yet and so Im borrowing money from my toxic parents to stay off the streets but this is bad deal. (Im LGBT+ and they are conservative Christians who want me in conversion therapy as soon as Im not seizing.) Im so anxious all the time, about whats happening and where my life is headed. Im angry that there are no answers or meds that seem to work for me, in fact I keep having allergic reactions to everything they put me on! Nobody gets it, friends, family, they try their best to support me but honestly even my therapist is acting like my life is a bit to far out there for her to know what to advise. How can I expect anybody else to understand? 
The cherry on the shit Sunday Is: I was so looking forward to attending a self discovery seminar, Hopefully just to find some motivation to push myself forward in this hard time But after being transparent about my condition they said I would have to have a doctor clear me before I could enroll. My neurologist today said if you think you can handle it, go for it, but just remember you cant guarantee that you wont have a seizure and you need to accommodate your bodies needs. When I told them that, they said its probably best to wait until I have things under control. Unfortunately I dont think there will ever be a point in my life where I can guarantee I wont have a seizure. Before, I just kindof thought, oh this is just a weird scary thing and hopefully it wont happen again. I dont think that is the case after having so many seizures recently and finding what they did in my brain. I think realizing that, just completely broke my spirit. Realizing not just my job, but the concerts, clubs and events I want to attend are not accommodating of people who have epilepsy/seizure disorders. I just turned 25 end of November and had to skip my birthday celebration gift of a concert to be in the hospital! (Not that I could have gone because flashing lights.) My friends dont even really want to hang out with me because theyre worried Ill have a seizure, and to be honest I dont really want to make them responsible for taking care of me. I just feel so out of control, and that Im missing out. Im supposed to be doing amazing things in my life, living independently, bettering myself and just enjoying my 20s. Ive just been confined in my apartment or forced to be with family that barely tolerates my identity. This is no way to live filled with anxiety and fear. Idk what Im even hoping to get from posting this Empathy? Advice? Tbh Im probably just ranting, Im just so frustrated. 
Ive been lurking on this sub, but havent posted because reading everyones stories is(dont take this the wrong way) depressing. Either people share how their life is so together now and how amazing it is to be seizure free (which is great, glad you can celebrate that milestone, just hard to take in when Im sliding down this crapshoot) or theyre people who have no answers and are as desperate as me to find some. I guess Im adding my story to that mix. Does anyone have answers? Suggestions? I feel like a bitter, feeble old grandparent when Im supposed to be in my prime.

563,roijeo,t5_2qlaa,"Acid reflux diet
This is a long one, so sorry in advance! 

Hey guys! I'm 21F and I've had GERD for years, so my doctor prescribed me with 20mg omeprazole a while back. I've been on and off of it for a while now. The last time I've been taking it, it definitely helped to the point that I began just taking it every other day. I will say though, for the past month I have been eating my triggers since I was better. Nothing happened. Until a few weeks back, I had a cocktail at this club (safely of course, it's still covid!) And I guess maybe I didn't eat enough cause the next day - my stomach was in shreds and I felt kinda ""hungover"" for the first time! Well, I'm assuming that's what set it off! It was a strawberry margarita and I was only sipping it cause I was the DD but eventually I could tell I was beginning to get tipsy, so I stopped drinking it. I'm assuming it was really strong even though it didn't taste strong. 

I was so nauseous, had stomach pain, constant belching, bloating, and diarrhea after eating short ribs my mom made (which is red meat and has a lot of fat). I was okay the day after, I was eating regularly again. Then one day when I was suppose to see the new Spiderman movie with my dad, I ate some taco bell before hand (I never get sick from there, so this was weird for me.) And I'm assuming cause of how spicy it was - I was SO sick to my stomach. I kept leaving and entering the theater to use the bathroom. It was so bad I just had my mom come and pick me up and let my dad see the movie since I bought his ticket for his birthday. But now, I've realized it's because of my triggers and now I'm so sensitive to them like I've never been before. 

I noticed that my omeperzole was running low so I put in an email to my doctor for a refill and the receptionist contacted me saying that he wants me to start weeing off of it (great timing ) by taking it every other day for two weeks, then taking it M,W,F for two weeks then stopping but to take Pepcid complete (the chewables) in between if needed. I think it's working but I will eat something, not even know it's a trigger until I'm a nauseous, bloated mess like 30 mins later and I search up if the food I ate is a trigger and wouldn't you know it: most of the time it is! I did email my doctor for his input and am waiting for his response. It doesnt help that I have emetophobia (fear of vomiting) as well! Even though I know I necessarily don't HAVE to throw up since that wouldn't really solve much and just mess up my throat. But I will have a wave of strong nausea and think I'm gonna be sick and nothing happens and then I just burp a few times. It's fucking annoying!

So I'm asking if you guys have went through this before and has it gotten better and what changes to your diet did you do to help you? Im honestly feeling really sad cause now I'm worried that it'll get to the point that I barely can eat. I use to be really skinny and I never want to go through that again.  I'm literally scared to eat sometimes!

566,rze5ac,t5_2qlaa,"I feel like my GERD and hiatus hernia is ruining my life.
I dont mean to be dramatic but that is truly how I feel. I am plagued every single day by unrelenting nausea, reflux and anxiety due to food. I cannot go out to eat at restaurants because I spend half the time at the table trying not to throw up and the other half in the bathroom feeling miserable or actually dry reaching in the sink. Nausea has been my number one unbearable symptom.


I am not an anxious person and I never have been. It has been a steady decline ever since my GERD symptoms began, and it is currently the worst it has ever been. A tiny butterfly feeling in my stomach in any situation seems to be driven into overdrive and my body reacts in ways my mind doesnt understand. The only way I can describe it is the physical manifestation of anxiety without the mind component of stress/overthinking. 


I take 40mg of Pantoprazole every day which helps with most of the mild daily symptoms like the burning feeling in my throat, but it doesnt seem to protect me from flares and other symptoms. Taking Domperidone 10mg prior to meals helped slightly but my eating schedule of small frequent meals made it tricky to incorporate in every day life. I tend to be spontaneous with eating food so my nausea doesnt have time to catch up. I cough uncontrollably every time after I eat substantial meals, bringing up phlegm that I feel like Im choking on unless I hack it up. I suffer from constipation daily, and diarrhoea during flares.


Ive lost nearly all interest in food. I no longer enjoy eating and I dont look forward to any meals. I cannot eat a normal full sized meal without throwing up and need to stick to small frequent snacks. This mindset change is so different from who I used it be. I used to love travelling and eating amazing foods all over the world (before Covid) but now that seems like my current worst nightmare. 


Recently Ive been making myself throw up as a last ditch effort to get some relief from the nausea I feel, sometimes on an empty stomach or even after meals. I know this isnt a healthy coping mechanism but desperation makes people do crazy things. 


My doctor who I worked with through initial diagnosis, endoscopy and increasing PPI requirements was quick to dismiss any surgical intervention, focussing on symptoms management.

567,rze5ac,t5_2qlaa,"I feel like my GERD and hiatus hernia is ruining my life.
I dont mean to be dramatic but that is truly how I feel. I am plagued every single day by unrelenting nausea, reflux and anxiety due to food. I cannot go out to eat at restaurants because I spend half the time at the table trying not to throw up and the other half in the bathroom feeling miserable or actually dry reaching in the sink. Nausea has been my number one unbearable symptom.


I am not an anxious person and I never have been. It has been a steady decline ever since my GERD symptoms began, and it is currently the worst it has ever been. A tiny butterfly feeling in my stomach in any situation seems to be driven into overdrive and my body reacts in ways my mind doesnt understand. The only way I can describe it is the physical manifestation of anxiety without the mind component of stress/overthinking. 


I take 40mg of Pantoprazole every day which helps with most of the mild daily symptoms like the burning feeling in my throat, but it doesnt seem to protect me from flares and other symptoms. Taking Domperidone 10mg prior to meals helped slightly but my eating schedule of small frequent meals made it tricky to incorporate in every day life. I tend to be spontaneous with eating food so my nausea doesnt have time to catch up. I cough uncontrollably every time after I eat substantial meals, bringing up phlegm that I feel like Im choking on unless I hack it up. I suffer from constipation daily, and diarrhoea during flares.


Ive lost nearly all interest in food. I no longer enjoy eating and I dont look forward to any meals. I cannot eat a normal full sized meal without throwing up and need to stick to small frequent snacks. This mindset change is so different from who I used it be. I used to love travelling and eating amazing foods all over the world (before Covid) but now that seems like my current worst nightmare. 


Recently Ive been making myself throw up as a last ditch effort to get some relief from the nausea I feel, sometimes on an empty stomach or even after meals. I know this isnt a healthy coping mechanism but desperation makes people do crazy things. 


My doctor who I worked with through initial diagnosis, endoscopy and increasing PPI requirements was quick to dismiss any surgical intervention, focussing on symptoms management. The whole situation is so emotionally potent to me I cant talk about it without breaking down to tears, so Im worried to express my full and true experience with him or other doctors for fear of looking like a stupid, anxious hypochondriac.

My appointment was scheduled last Thursday and was set for a month out, but I work for the healthcare chain and know more about our services than some others and after talking with the nurse, wound up with an appointment today with a different facility via telehealth. After looking at my labs, my neuro said everything looked normal besides a few being borderline low, so recommended retesting. Negative Lupis, RA, thyroid etc. He said my symptoms are more inline with a deficiency of some sort but labs were fine and he didnt like that I had fascinations, especially in the face, or leg tremors when holding them up as instructed. Thats when he mentioned MS as a possibility and has ordered an MRI of the brain and spine.

Im grateful I was able to have an appointment with a neurologist so quickly, and one that was surprisingly thorough. Im aware that this could be caused by something completely other than MS, but it has been something at the back of mind. I just turned 31, so Im a bit anxious and nervous but ready for answers.

Hi all. Semi frequent lurker. First time poster.

Im on about day 6 of a flare up in my big toe. This is year three of me having a flare up around the same time of year (sometime in the winter). Ive never been prescribed anything besides NSAIDs but have been taking a tapering dose of prednisone that my mother in law had in reserve (former nurse). 

This flare up is particularly frustrating because in the last year, Ive made major positive changes in my lifestyle. I went on noom, lost about 65 pounds (63, current weight 237). I have been drinking minimum 80 ounces of water a day for the last year) and intensely exercise usually 5 of 7 days a week. I also have been taking a single tart cherry extract supplement every day for over a year. I drink infrequently, maybe one night on the weekend, and not that much to boot.

Ive never felt physically better until this shit hits me like a brick.

Part of the reason I decided to make these changes was because of my first gout attack 3 years ago. Absolutely miserable experience. My dad has a history of it but I thought Id at least get a few years more before it effected me (currently 31 years old). Hes been on Allo but has never decided to lose his own weight. 

I have another doctors appointment on Friday where theyre planning to test UA levels and do a kidney analysis. 

My question is, because this seems to be a yearly thing and not as frequent an occurrence as some others in this sub have unfortunately experienced, should I bite the bullet and just demand allo? Or should I just keep a stash of prednisone on me for flare ups (even though it hasnt done much for me for this attack)?

This last attack has seemed to last longer than the others but hasnt been as acutely painful. But its gotten me a little depressed as I havent been able to move and my weight loss journey has come to a grinding halt.

I had my first tonic clonic seizure when I was 10 years old (looking back I was almost definitely having absence seizures before that though). I was able to get the tonic clonics well-controlled with Lamictal though I kept having absence. I had another tonic clonic at 17, but that was my last one for over 10 years, when I had two within a year. They were blamed on sleep deprivation all 3 of those times, but my neurologist added Keppra to be safe after the third one. 

That was 4 years ago and I've been seizure free--definitely from tonic clonic, but I remember very few if any absence seizures in that time either (switching from irregular food service hours to a typical 9-5 made a HUGE improvement in my life).

Until Sunday. I wasn't sleep deprived. I hadn't missed any medications (at least, I really don't THINK I did). I had no aura and felt totally normal all day. One second I'm looking for clean socks in the laundry basket, the next I'm waking up on my couch with EMS monitoring me. I declined going to the hospital (mostly because I can't afford the ambulance ride, but that's another rant for another time). Well, a few hours later, I had another one! I don't recall EVER having more than one in a day. I did end up going to the ER (by car) but they of course couldn't figure out anything wrong with me.

Long story short, I've been in bed basically all day since Sunday evening. First because of stubborn residual brain fog  and now from straight up depression.

I just wanted to hop on here and offer some encouragement for anyone who has undergone their first episode and think that they will never be able to enjoy life again, or get out of the loop of only thinking about this new thing you have to deal with. In Dec 2020 I went into psychosis and was out of touch with reality for 3 months. I would go in and out of thinking I was in hell. I had no prior drug use or any mental health issues except for some mild depression in college. After the screaming thoughts of condemnation in my head stopped i just felt empty. I could not enjoy anything. I thought I had my soul stolen. I thought I was already condemned to hell and living in it now. I remembered how normal my life was and just wished so desperately to be back in the old me who didnt know this kind of hell on earth existed. Everyone had suggestions.. just think positively just overcome it in your mind.capture your thoughts. Pray away the demonic influences etc. It was so frustrating because NONE of those people knew what it felt like to have your sanity ripped out from underneath you, literally overnight. I was given a pretty bad prognosis and had to mourn the fact I probably wouldnt be able to work at all or what I went to school for. My entire life upended. I suffered for another 5 months no emotions, no enjoyment, just massive weight gain. I continued to fall into a deeper black hole than the one I was in. It had gotten to the point where I was REALLY going to kill myself. I would post on Reddit every day Im going to kill myself over and over and over. Several times I would have the whole bottle of my benzos in my hand to do it. I even saved them up for the occasion but I would tell myself just wait one more day. You can do it tomorrow if nothing happens finally the climax arrived. After going to a spiritual healing retreat which was my last ditch effort. I told my mom I was going to kill myself. My dad got mad at me when I got home because I threw a pill bottle at him and then he choked me. THIS was the WORST day of my life. Then I was proceeded to be called crazy and admitted me to the mental hospital for a second time. This is my turning point. They put me on lithium but the real suggestion that changed everything was Wellbutrin. They didnt put me on it when I was in the hospital, but advised my regular psych to put me on it a week later when I got out. After a week of being on Wellbutrin.. I started to be able to walk outside again I got ready to see one of my friends it was a slow progression, but I noticed myself getting better and better. - finally now I am 13 months post my only psychotic episode, and Im back to work with my full cognitive abilities back I am dating again, I can feel emotions and I dont think about this illness every day. I just take my pills and have moved on.

Hi All,

23M and was diagnosed yesterday after having a week of head pressure and somewhat presyncope episodes. Had COVID earlier in the month (3x vaxxed) so I believe this was triggering. 

Just looking for general advice going forward, I know I am to up my water intake, sodium, buy compression socks, and to exercise regularly. Thankfully, I feel that I am able to go on walks / generally able to avoid presyncope when I am moving on my feet.

Doc doesnt want to use medications just yet due to main symptoms being my head pressure, which has since diminished. Is the goal for water/salt/exercise to lower peak heart rate, or just to eliminate symptoms? What are signs of improvement generally? 
Is it bad to push myself with cardio workouts right away, if I am able? Also, any general tips for salt intake ( should I consume it prior to water consumption?) 

Hoping to see a cardiologist in the near future to get more details. Been very down after hearing this news but reassuring to see many on a similar boat w/ great improvement.

591,sxeqne,t5_2s3g1,"The medical gaslighting is real.
Little bit of a backstory: almost everything triggers me if I eat just enough of it. Ive been hospitalized several times throughout the past decade, got the usual medical gaslighting from doctors, got admitted to a psych ward because doctors thought I was lying, went through a series of medications before finding a good one (and finally, the pills that work cost over $1,000 so I cant take them everyday, I literally have to ration them out for what I feel are my worst days). 

Save enough money, then pay for about 60 pills to ration. Ran out pretty recently. Great! Right now my stomach is on fire, I dont know what triggered it, and my eyes are watering from the pain as I take 3+ dosages of mylanta and famotidine. Needless to say, I am livid right now because I have a life to live and several doctors have made it clear that this isnt going away, and that I must be missing some sort of magical formula. 

Fodmap diets have never worked for me even in the past. I discovered that not everything on the list triggers me, and foods that arent on the list are a total gamble. I have constant anxiety because its just a total gamble. I dont understand why doctors could figure out what causes cancer, but not why my digestive system hates me and why blueberries triggered me last year but a few months later my body is totally fine with it. 

I dont even bother going to the hospital anymore because all they can do for me is force me to perform the same blood tests over and over again and of course nothing shows up. They either sell you empty hope by saying good news, it looks like youre completely healthy and not dying! Or they force you to be committed for being mental.

I dont know if Im glad. I am willing to bet that half of us arent glad about any of this. We have to actually live with this pain and we will likely never know why the fuck its happening because theres no known cause or cure for it and even GI would tell you well looks like its just ibs flaring up- eat whatever you want as long as it doesnt make you feel like shit afterwards!.

Just a quick preface:

 6'5, 215lbs, 23 years old

Began getting horrendous bloating and fullness after drinking alcohol. Decided to lay off the alcohol and it was my gut feeling (excuse the pun ;) ) to go and see a doctor. Doctor performed an ultra-sound and endoscopy to rule out celiac. Whilst nothing was found, upon performing the endoscopy it was discovered that the food i had eaten c. 10 hours prior was partially undigested.

603,rkcxfc,t5_2qlaa,"My Recovery Journey
Hey everyone!

I just wanted to come on here and share my story.  Back in January I started getting intense episodes of vomiting and had a gnawing pain in my stomach.  I also was dealing with bloating, nonstop burping, acid reflux, and alternating constipation and diarrhea. My entire GI system was a wreck - I lost nearly 50 pounds in 3 months and was very underweight. After a few trips to the ER I was referred to a GI doctor who diagnosed me with gastritis and prescribed me a PPI, but was not really helpful in providing me with other guidance on how to heal. The PPI gave me a lot of side effects and was not helping my symptoms (might have actually been making them worse). After several months of not seeing progress and continuing to lose weight, I went to see a functional medicine doctor, who quickly suggested mold toxicity. I had testing done in my apartment which confirmed the presence of toxic mold and submitted a urine test, which showed I had high levels of 3 different types of mold toxins in my system. I moved out of my apartment and started a detox regiment and a candida cleanse (mold makes it easy for candida to grow and can lead to overgrowth). I also started eating an extremely clean diet (no sugar, processed foods, dairy, gluten, or caffeine). Since then most of my symptoms have subsided and I have my life back. I am back at work and was even able to get married and go on my honeymoon in Italy this past August.

Hey everyone!

I just wanted to come on here and share my story.  Back in January I started getting intense episodes of vomiting and had a gnawing pain in my stomach.  I also was dealing with bloating, nonstop burping, acid reflux, and alternating constipation and diarrhea. My entire GI system was a wreck - I lost nearly 50 pounds in 3 months and was very underweight. After a few trips to the ER I was referred to a GI doctor who diagnosed me with gastritis and prescribed me a PPI, but was not really helpful in providing me with other guidance on how to heal. The PPI gave me a lot of side effects and was not helping my symptoms (might have actually been making them worse). After several months of not seeing progress and continuing to lose weight, I went to see a functional medicine doctor, who quickly suggested mold toxicity. I had testing done in my apartment which confirmed the presence of toxic mold and submitted a urine test, which showed I had high levels of 3 different types of mold toxins in my system. I moved out of my apartment and started a detox regiment and a candida cleanse (mold makes it easy for candida to grow and can lead to overgrowth). I also started eating an extremely clean diet (no sugar, processed foods, dairy, gluten, or caffeine). Since then most of my symptoms have subsided and I have my life back. I am back at work and was even able to get married and go on my honeymoon in Italy this past August.

609,s68xzo,t5_2s23e,"Experience with gilenya withdrawal?
I've been diagnosed with MS for about three years now. I started gilenya, and everything was completely normal. No new lessions, no new symptoms, my life was basically unaffected by my diagnosis.

And then last december, everything went to shit. My mom had to be rushed to the hospital for a life threatening emergency that almost killed her. She was in the ICU for three weeks. During this time, my own health was the last of my priorities. I kept missing doses, taking my pills irregularly until I ran out, and then I didn't even bother refilling my prescription. I was so depressed thinking that my mom was going to die that I truly didn't care about it.

Last week she was finally released from the hospital and our life is slowly turning back to normal. I contacted my neuro, got scolded like a child (probably deserved it) and got my prescription. Because of COVID related delays though, it's gonna be a while until I get it. Rn it's been a week from when I took my last dose. 

(I asked a similar question in a similar forum and got well intentioned advice to contact gilenya for some sort of emergency program, but they don't have a local presence in my country so sadly that's not possible for me. My neurologist doesn't keep any around for emergencies either. Third world country stuff.)

So I just wanted to ask if any of you have been off gilenya for a similar time? What was your experience? Did you have a relapse? I've literally never had one since I started treatment, so the thought is a little scary, specially since I'm my mom's caretaker now.

Thank you so much if you've read this far!! And yeah. I know I was irresponsible and stupid. I heard enough about that from my mom and my neuro.

Ive had POTS for 6 years now, finally diagnosed a year ago. About a year before the POTS symptoms began, I was widowed with a baby. I moved cross country to be with my family and started college full time, and just before my first semester ended the POTS started and I had to withdraw from school. Then my family scattered. I lived alone with my kid for a couple of years, with the symptoms my doctors couldnt fix and the constant feeling of almost dying. I was terrified that Id faint or die, that my little boy would be left behind. Now we live with some friends, but the situation isnt going to be stable for long and I need to get out.

Not enough go for a walk or go to work or go to school. I dont feel like I can deal with living alone again. I have a therapist and a psych, both have run out of ways to help unless my POTS is better controlled.

I dont see anything getting better, and Im so discouraged. For years now Ive been telling myself that when Im better, Ill be able to do things. Ill be able to continue the plan I put in place after my husband died. Buy another house.

Get out of the house, go to the gym again, make some friends, maybe fall in love again. Im coming to realize that these things are very probably not going to be possible. The depression and anxiety have become crippling.

I dont know what to do. My kid needs more than just me. I need more than just me. My siblings lives do not have room for us.

617,rokh2f,t5_2qlaa,"Sharing my personal journey (and hoping some of my tips/tricks work for you!)
Hey!

I see a lot of you guys suffering with this terrible disease on here. Whether you're super informed about meds that are typically prescribed for reflux or not, I'm going to detail everything I've tried in hopes some of what I'm saying sticks, or maybe what worked for me will work for you!

**Tips:**

1. **If a medication or dose is not working for you, TELL YOUR DOCTOR**. For example, if you're on Pantoprazole/Protonix and you feel the drug is not working, your doctor might up your dose (typically, 20mg is a lower dose; 40mg is the highest dose for this drug), or they might switch you to an H2 Blocker, like Famotidine/Pepcid. Or they could put you on a drug like Carafate/Sucalfrate.
2. **If you have titrated up and down on a medication, it might be time to TRY A NEW DRUG**. For example, if you tried Pantoprazole at 20 and 40mg, and you are still experiencing no relief, ask your doctor for a PPI that's not Pantoprazole. There is...

\-Dexilant (30 and 60mg- prescription only))

\-Prilosec (prescription doses are 10/20/40mg)

\-Nexium (20 and 40mg- prescription doses)

\-Aciphex (30 and 60mg- prescription only)

\-Prevacid (15 and 30mg- prescription only)

\-Zegerid/Omeprazole (10/20/40mg- prescription doses)

**And these H2 Blockers:**

\-Famotidine (10/20/40mg- prescription only)

\-Nizatidine (60/90/100/120/180 mL- prescription only)

\-Cimetidine (200/300/400/800mg- prescription doses)

3. **If your doctor is suggesting getting tests done, do them ALL**. Usually diagnostic testing is encouraged/required for getting a surgery referral. Even if you don't go the surgery route, it is still important information for you and your doctor(s). These are the tests I got (and you can ask your doctors about these):

**-Gastric emptying**

**-Upper abdominal ultrasound**

**-Upper endoscopy (usually one of the required tests for surgery)**

**-Barium swallow**

**-Esophageal manometry (usually one of the required tests for surgery)**

**-Bravo (usually one of the required tests for surgery)**

**-24pH test/impedance test (usually one of the required tests for surgery)**

4. **Know surgery IS an option, and the surgeries generally have good outcomes. Different surgeries available for acid reflux:**

**-LINX**

**-Stretta**

**-Nissen Fundoplication**

**-TIF**

**-Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass**

5. If your GERD is correlated with your anxiety, these meds. helped me and might help you (w/ anxiety and acid reflux):

**-SSRI's (Lexapro, Zoloft, Celexa, Prozac, Paxil).**

**-SNRI's (Effexor, Fetzima, Cymbalta, Pristiq)**

**Also, therapies such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy can help. It might be helpful to see a therapist that specializes in ANXIETY and/or CHRONIC ILLNESS.**

6. **Avoid high-fat, spicy, deep fried foods. Stick to alkaline foods. These foods/drinks helped with my symptoms:**

\-Fruits such as apples, bananas, beets, apricots

\-Really any vegetable (except for acidic veggies like onions)

\-Oatmeal/oats

\-Yogurts (try to stick to low-fat; probiotic yogurt is also an EXCELLENT choice)

\-Water

\-Chamomile Tea

\-Lavender Tea

7. Avoid caffeine/nicotine/alcohol-- these are drugs that **can relax the LES.**

Let me know if these tips were helpful! Hope you guys get relief soon! It's going on a year since I had the LINX with hiatal hernia repair and I'm currently on 50mg Zoloft (it's been 2 months so far). So far, anxiety/depression is manageable and I am reflux-free :) I want you guys to have a happy ending, too!",claim_per_exp,". **Avoid high-fat, spicy, deep fried foods. Stick to alkaline foods.

Hey!

I see a lot of you guys suffering with this terrible disease on here. Whether you're super informed about meds that are typically prescribed for reflux or not, I'm going to detail everything I've tried in hopes some of what I'm saying sticks, or maybe what worked for me will work for you!

**Tips:**

1. **If a medication or dose is not working for you, TELL YOUR DOCTOR**. For example, if you're on Pantoprazole/Protonix and you feel the drug is not working, your doctor might up your dose (typically, 20mg is a lower dose; 40mg is the highest dose for this drug), or they might switch you to an H2 Blocker, like Famotidine/Pepcid. Or they could put you on a drug like Carafate/Sucalfrate.
2. **If you have titrated up and down on a medication, it might be time to TRY A NEW DRUG**. For example, if you tried Pantoprazole at 20 and 40mg, and you are still experiencing no relief, ask your doctor for a PPI that's not Pantoprazole. There is...

\-Dexilant (30 and 60mg- prescription only))

\-Prilosec (prescription doses are 10/20/40mg)

\-Nexium (20 and 40mg- prescription doses)

\-Aciphex (30 and 60mg- prescription only)

\-Prevacid (15 and 30mg- prescription only)

\-Zegerid/Omeprazole (10/20/40mg- prescription doses)

**And these H2 Blockers:**

\-Famotidine (10/20/40mg- prescription only)

\-Nizatidine (60/90/100/120/180 mL- prescription only)

\-Cimetidine (200/300/400/800mg- prescription doses)

3. **If your doctor is suggesting getting tests done, do them ALL**. Usually diagnostic testing is encouraged/required for getting a surgery referral. Even if you don't go the surgery route, it is still important information for you and your doctor(s). These are the tests I got (and you can ask your doctors about these):

**-Gastric emptying**

**-Upper abdominal ultrasound**

**-Upper endoscopy (usually one of the required tests for surgery)**

**-Barium swallow**

**-Esophageal manometry (usually one of the required tests for surgery)**

**-Bravo (usually one of the required tests for surgery)**

**-24pH test/impedance test (usually one of the required tests for surgery)**

4. **Know surgery IS an option, and the surgeries generally have good outcomes. Different surgeries available for acid reflux:**

**-LINX**

**-Stretta**

**-Nissen Fundoplication**

**-TIF**

**-Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass**

5. If your GERD is correlated with your anxiety, these meds. helped me and might help you (w/ anxiety and acid reflux):

**-SSRI's (Lexapro, Zoloft, Celexa, Prozac, Paxil).**

**-SNRI's (Effexor, Fetzima, Cymbalta, Pristiq)**

**Also, therapies such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy can help. It might be helpful to see a therapist that specializes in ANXIETY and/or CHRONIC ILLNESS.**

6. **Avoid high-fat, spicy, deep fried foods. Stick to alkaline foods. These foods/drinks helped with my symptoms:**

\-Fruits such as apples, bananas, beets, apricots

\-Really any vegetable (except for acidic veggies like onions)

\-Oatmeal/oats

\-Yogurts (try to stick to low-fat; probiotic yogurt is also an EXCELLENT choice)

\-Water

\-Chamomile Tea

\-Lavender Tea

7. Avoid caffeine/nicotine/alcohol-- these are drugs that **can relax the LES.**

Hi so I was recently diagnosed with POTS (18 years old) and my GI issues are debilitating. I mean I just figured they were flare ups but it just seems too aggressive to be. Intense bloating, abdominal cramps, and on and off BM issues. I have recently stumbled across MCAS, and have wondered if thats possibly my problem. I also take corlanor for my POTS which I was hoping to feel so much better with taking it, but honestly no change in the way I feel. So I guess my question is has anyone else had the same issue and if so what do I even do to see if I have it? Is this something I can just bring up to my primary doctor about?

622,rz35jg,t5_2s1h9,"Drinking Alcohol and Epilepsy
Let me start off with my road to epilepsy. This is all sort of new to me so I might go on a bit of a rant here. I tell my story in hope that some may find it relatable and can help. 

In early 2019, I was 19 years old and in my second year of University studying Civil Engineering when i got very sick with mono at the start of a new semester. I battled the sickness for just over a month before i began to feel better but it had set me a bit back with my work and I was pretty screwed heading into midterms in what was a very heavy loaded semester, so i was stressed the fuck out but I studied my ass off and made it work. When I finished midterms, it was one of my closest friends birthdays, so we went out in the city to a club and got fucked up to celebrate - it was a rough month for me so i really went in. The next day I had experienced my very first seizure. I took every test there was in the hospital and nothing showed epileptic activity in my brain. They concluded that what happened to me was the perfect storm and that given i had just come off mono, was under a lot of stress, low on sleep and especially with the amount of alcohol I had in my system that it all factored. I was taking Dilatin for 2 months and then weened off after. They said I shouldnt drink like that ever again, or I could be at risk of another. 

For almost 3 years I watched myself when i drank, but my group of friends and I have always been sort of big drinkers since high school, and we would drink almost every weekend. I never let myself get to the same point I was at that night in 2019, but I would still drink more than just a couple beers and be fine, so over time I started to get more comfortable again with drinking more. In October 2021, under almost identical circumstances as the first time, I had another seizure after a night out of binge drinking and after recovering from a rough cold all while in the middle of midterms. This seizure wasnt nearly as bad but I had an aura it was coming the morning I woke up hungover. I was put back on Dilatin for 2 months afterwards and then I was told by my neurologist that since I had another one I should start on Keppra 1000 mg daily, and it was my choice if i wanted to but he wouldnt write a letter to get my drivers license back if I wasnt on it. 

I wasnt for the idea of being on meds long term since I didnt think my seizures were random or being caused from epilepsy as both my EEGs didnt show I had epilepsy and it was very clear to me now that if I drank too much (especially while under a lot of stress and lack of sleep) that a seizure could be triggered and this wasnt just a one time fluke. I wanted my license back though so I agreed to transition from Dilatin to Keppra in order to get it. 

After being on Keppra for a week I was experiencing bad side effects and decided to ween myself off taking them since I constantly felt like shit and thought they were unnecessary. 3 days after I had stopped taking the meds altogether, I had my most recent seizure (earlier this week). Now im back on Keppra 1000 mg daily and trying my best to adjust to the meds since its official i need to be on them long term. 

I guess my question now is: since Im committing to Keppra for the long run, should I be okay to have a couple drinks sometimes while on it? I know that drinking has provoked seizures in me before but that was when I had mixed heavily and drank way more than moderately. Being only 22 years old and having years of drinking with friends in the past is making it hard for me to accept the possibility of quitting drinking altogether. 

I was also on weed heavy at one point too, im not sure how that would interact with Keppra as well. I havent drank or smoked for months now, and I do intend on asking my neurologist for further advice as well but I came here to see if i can get any relatable personal experiences",claim_per_exp,"After being on Keppra for a week I was experiencing bad side effects and decided to ween myself off taking them since I constantly felt like shit and thought they were unnecessary. 3 days after I had stopped taking the meds altogether, I had my most recent seizure (earlier this week).

The CT scan came back clear.

However, I know that CT scans are not always very useful in diagnosing MS as they arent as detailed as MRIs, and Im still concerned. I have had the EBV which I know severely increases my chances for MS. I also have low vitamin D levels which I think I have read being correlated with MS as well.

My main symptoms are tremors, typically occurring in the legs and specifically my left hand. I have a different kind of spasm that happens with my right hand, but they never happen together and dont seem to be the same issue. I have noticed my speech has deteriorated a bit lately; my stuttering has worsened and I have a hard time getting my words out properly or thinking of the words Im trying to use. I have episodes where my arms and legs become very weak and I feel completely drained of energy. I also have episodes of weakness that occur in the left side of my body specifically. I have a difficult time keeping my eyes focused. I have heavy brain fog. I have balance issues and often bounce off of things as I walk. 

Clearly, something isnt right, but Im not sure how to proceed. I know I share a lot of symptoms associated with MS, but these are also symptoms associated with other neurological disorders and a whole range of different things. I know that it often takes years to find the proper diagnosis, whether it is for MS or other things. Should I bring up my concern specifically for MS with my doctor? Should I ask to be referred to a neurologist? 

Sometimes I start feeling better and think that this isnt something I need to worry about anymore.

So I've been a gout sufferer for few years and I know my triggers: beer & regular soda with sugar. And it always attacks my ankle and knee. 

Few weeks ago it was a stressful day at work on Friday and I opened the fridge without thinking and grabbed a can of Coke Zero and drank it in one gulp but in reality it was regular Coke.

Sure enough, the next morning I was feeling the tingling sensation. We happen to have the family Zoom call and my MIL who lives in Korea hears that I am suffering from gout. She tells me that she will send us something that's good for gout and I don't think much of it. By Sunday morning, I was having a full blown gout attack and my right ankle is stiff as hell. 

A package arrives on following Wed from Korea and it was this weird looking machine that looks like a foot massager. As I am reading the manual, it sounds like a total snake oil. It talks about how cancer happens more often to those that have lower body temperature and raising 1 degree celsius in your core body temperature can reduce the risk of cancer by more than 50%. It also talks about how the high frequency current that's emitted from this machine creating thermal energy will make the cells in your body vibrate and help with all types of joint pains. By then I was fully convinced this was a fraud and I called me MIL and was like I ain't falling for this horseshit and told her I will be sending it  for her to get a refund. But she's adamant that I give it a try since someone else that she knows who was suffering from gout big time has been using the same machine and it has helped significantly.

So I decide to give it a try. Within a minute or two, you can feel the warmth and as times goes by, I am feeling this tiny shocks all over my feet and within 15 mins I am sweating like I ran a marathon. 

About an hour after I finish the session, I can feel the stiffness on my ankle subsiding just a little bit. I wanted to try it once again but the manual says only to do one 30 min session every 12 hours. So the next morning as soon as I woke up, I did it again and sure enough, I gained more flexibility around my ankle to the point where I was able to grab it and crack my ankle which usually is the sign that my gout is going away. This normally happens about a week after the full attack starts. But with this device, I was pain free within 48 hours and everything was back to normal. 

To test if this was not just a placebo effect, I drank 2 cans of beer few days later but it didn't cause an attack and I am afraid to try again for obvious reasons. I even sent out a message to people that I know in my area to see if anyone was suffering from gout and if so, come and try this machine to see if it actually works for them as well.  

By no means, I am trying to start a controversy or gain anything materially from this (I am not even posting anything particular about the product and googling won't help either) but anyone else has heard about high frequency thermal treatment for gout? My MIL called the manufacturer and they are claiming the high frequency thermal energy is causing the uric crystals to vibrate and they are being shaken off from the joint and going back into the bloodstream.

Hi everyone!

This has been a rough go but Ill try to explain. I never had heartburn in my life until getting pregnant in 2019. Pepcid worked for me when I was pregnant but it stopped working a couple months postpartum. 
I started taking omeprazole 20 Dec 2019 and it worked like a charm. I had no issues until February 2021 when I started getting digestive issues of stomach aches and gas. Tested positive for h pylori and Sibo which I treated with antimicrocials successfully. The naturopath doctor suggested I wean off ppis and I had been successfully taken 10mgs without symptoms for 6 weeks. I came off ppis and didnt have symptoms for 12 days and got intense burning back pain and throat pain in august.

So I got back on 20mg and this is where the yo-yo began. I tried tapering off 2 more times and failed each time needing a higher dose to manage my symptoms.

December 5th I accidently ate guacamole that had jalapeños in it and have been suffering ever since(mind you I was on nexium 40mg at the time):
Burning back pain 
Throat burning 
Clogged ears 
Voice hoarseness

Currently Ive been on 80mg of nexium since December 9th, had an endoscopy on 12/22 which was clear and negative for biopsies. I do have a 2cm sliding hiatal hernia.

Things Im trying:
Ppis

Pepcid before bed
Stop eating 3 hours before bed

Hi everyone!

This has been a rough go but Ill try to explain. I never had heartburn in my life until getting pregnant in 2019. Pepcid worked for me when I was pregnant but it stopped working a couple months postpartum. 
I started taking omeprazole 20 Dec 2019 and it worked like a charm. I had no issues until February 2021 when I started getting digestive issues of stomach aches and gas. Tested positive for h pylori and Sibo which I treated with antimicrocials successfully. The naturopath doctor suggested I wean off ppis and I had been successfully taken 10mgs without symptoms for 6 weeks. I came off ppis and didnt have symptoms for 12 days and got intense burning back pain and throat pain in august.

So I got back on 20mg and this is where the yo-yo began. I tried tapering off 2 more times and failed each time needing a higher dose to manage my symptoms.

December 5th I accidently ate guacamole that had jalapeños in it and have been suffering ever since(mind you I was on nexium 40mg at the time):
Burning back pain 
Throat burning 
Clogged ears 
Voice hoarseness

Currently Ive been on 80mg of nexium since December 9th, had an endoscopy on 12/22 which was clear and negative for biopsies. I do have a 2cm sliding hiatal hernia.

Things Im trying:
Ppis
A wedge pillow
Gaviscon advance 
Pepcid before bed
Stop eating 3 hours before bed
Currently in healing phase acid watchers diet

TL;DR: Seizure number 2/3 3 years after seizure 1. Time to surrender my license? What are medication side effects like? What do I need to be aware of? 

I had a seizure in late 2018. I was about 19 and I was abusing a few different drugs at the time but was generally responsible and never mixed them. I was on a stimulant (Vyvanse) when the first one happened.

Since then I only use weed and nicotine. I had attributed the first one to stimulant use + not taking care of myself.

This second one happened after a Publix sub. no drugs.

I guess that means I'm epileptic.

657,otzijr,t5_2syer,"First time with gout. Advice/experience
Hello, I dont post often but stumbled upon this wonderful subreddit last night as I couldnt sleep due to the pain.

Im M/27 and overweight/heavy drinker. After getting married a few months ago I decided it was time for some changes and went to my PD for the first time in years. Had gained about 80lbs since going when I was 21 and told the doctor I had been drinking about 6/7 days. My liver enzymes were about 3 times elevated. In the weeks since then Ive lost about 10 pounds and had quit drinking on weekdays and doing moderate exercise/eating a much healthy diet(which did include a lot of chicken and fish)

About two weeks ago I woke up thinking I had broken my ankle. After suffering for a few days I went to urgent care thinking I had a blood clot or something and they told me it was gout. Prescribed me prednisone and hydrocodone. I started feeling better within a day and was pretty much back to normal by the following week. 

However I have another flare up now and cant walk again. Im trying to go to see my PD because Im not sure if I should really be taking prednisone and hydrocodone with my high liver enzymes. Ive seen a lot of talk about colchicine and allopurinal. Just wondering if anyone else has similar experiences and knows if these would be better for me. Also, Im guessing cutting back to weekend only drinking is not going to be enough to stop the attacks.

I have been diagnosed with Gout and have a few questions for the community.  About my diagnosis:

Father and Brother have had gout attacks before but are not being treated for them, so I was pretty sure what was going on.  I initially contacted a free MDLive service my company pays for (online video call) and they prescribed Colchicine (3 tablets) and Indomethacin (3 per day).  I followed the docs instructions and after 15 days I had run out of Indomethacin and was still limping around, so I called my primary physician. (Pain wasn't at the initial flare level where even a sheet bothered my big toe but it was bad enough that I wasn't sleeping great and still couldn't get around easily.)

Primary Doc saw me, did a blood test (6.4 uric acid), gave me two shots (steroid and pain), and prescribed Allo and Indomethacin with the Allo starting 10 days later.  Later that day the shots had REALLY helped.

That was 5 or so days ago and I'm feeling about 95% recovered, no limp, and mostly regained full movement in the joint, although there is still inflammation just around the joint.

**So here is the question.**  I've got multiple things scheduled in the next 1+ months that are going to require alot of walking.  I worry that if I start Allo in the next 5 days I'm likely to experience another flare up that might make walking difficult again in this time frame.  I see so many people talk about flares when starting Allo but I'm hopeful that since this was my first and only attack it's less likely to occur?  Thoughts?  Advice?

Unfortunately I didn't think of this when I met with my Doc so I didn't get a chance to ask him about it.  Although I did ask him about NOT going on Allo because I hate the idea of being on any medicine and he said it was up to me but he would recommend it, so I DO plan on taking it.  Just not sure if it would be better to wait for a month before starting.

If relevant: 45/male/6'1/200lbs  (decent shape, been cutting out purines since this started and am I think doing a good job at it.)

Although I did ask him about NOT going on Allo because I hate the idea of being on any medicine and he said it was up to me but he would recommend it, so I DO plan on taking it.  Just not sure if it would be better to wait for a month before starting.

Dear brothers: 

Four year gout sufferer, weight 162 kilos. The problem is that lately gout or not I have constant pain on arms, burning sensation, can't walk properly anymore, no tophees but on echo scan they saw crystals in the muscles everywhere.

My uric acid level is always around 9, for monhts or maybe years. Never below 6.

So I decided to take allopurinol but I have no contact iwth a doctor at this moment that can manage my situation. So I ask my gout brothers. You are the only ones who understand gout anyway.

1) Can I take colchicine for months? low dosage, 3 months everyday? to prevent gout flares?

2) I'm afraid of hypersensitivity and other things, is better to try first with alternatives? 

3) Should I watch for any symptom to interrupt treatment?

4) When people say they dont tolerate allopurinol, why is that?

5) And the most important, did your lifestyle improved with allopurinol in the long term? did cronic low pain went away? could you flex your elbow as before? can walk again like a normal person?

One month out since I finished my Pantoprazole treatment... Still seems my lungs/body is recovering (there was other issues involved with too much smoking). The medication whole experience was generally very rough on me.

I've been eating super clean since my treatment started (almost exactly 2 months ago). LOTS of veggies LOTS of fruits, being back at my parents place my moms been helping me refeed (i lost over 30lbs and was so weak when i arrived home). Things felt they were generally getting better... but I had cough attacks I felt was from food. I decided to finally give in and start salbutamol (emergency inhaler/rapid bronchodilator). its affects last for about 4-6 hours and it really did help.

After a failed acupuncture session (2 weeks ago) to treat my foot edema (had it for 3+ mo.) I had this choke attack after eating alot of asparagus one night with Salmon. It was infront of my mother and I broke down. I then coupled salbutamol with symbiocort (200/4.5 mcg) both slow acting corto/broncho dilator, which affects last up to 12 hours.

The relief it provided me was great. Unfortunately after 2 weeks on symbicort my throat was getting very hoarse, and ive been dealing with bad laryngitis(throat edema) for almost 4 months now ( haven't been able to speak/swallow generally for 3 months) but much improved now, since cutting my dose in half.

I cut my dose in half (one puff twice a day) yesterday and my throat/endless mucus have gotten better. my plan is to get off the inhaler in a months time with reducing to 160/4.5 and then the 80/4.5 (aerosol).

I've been sort of trying to eat alot since I want to gain about 5 kgs back, but realized last night TOO many (or any for that matter) VEGGIES with RAFFINOSE, I.E. broccoli, carrots cabbage, totally aggravate my gastric issues. I also will now stay away from too many beans and over eating in general.

I funnily enough took my first dose 2TBSP of BRAGGS last night after heavy bloating/burping, and at first it felt GREAT and i thought I had found the golden key as my burping and inability to swallow was healed. Unfortunately that was NOT the case, I had horrible heart burn in bed until 7am and will not be taking it until at least 6 months out.

After a failed acupuncture session (2 weeks ago) to treat my foot edema (had it for 3+ mo.) I had this choke attack after eating alot of asparagus one night with Salmon. It was infront of my mother and I broke down. I then coupled salbutamol with symbiocort (200/4.5 mcg) both slow acting corto/broncho dilator, which affects last up to 12 hours.

The relief it provided me was great. Unfortunately after 2 weeks on symbicort my throat was getting very hoarse, and ive been dealing with bad laryngitis(throat edema) for almost 4 months now ( haven't been able to speak/swallow generally for 3 months) but much improved now, since cutting my dose in half.

I cut my dose in half (one puff twice a day) yesterday and my throat/endless mucus have gotten better. my plan is to get off the inhaler in a months time with reducing to 160/4.5 and then the 80/4.5 (aerosol).

I've been sort of trying to eat alot since I want to gain about 5 kgs back, but realized last night TOO many (or any for that matter) VEGGIES with RAFFINOSE, I.E. broccoli, carrots cabbage, totally aggravate my gastric issues. I also will now stay away from too many beans and over eating in general.

I funnily enough took my first dose 2TBSP of BRAGGS last night after heavy bloating/burping, and at first it felt GREAT and i thought I had found the golden key as my burping and inability to swallow was healed. Unfortunately that was NOT the case, I had horrible heart burn in bed until 7am and will not be taking it until at least 6 months out.

Anyhow I just want to share some of my experience POST treatment. and in general to be careful with BRAGS VINEGAR/ASPARAGUS TYPE VEGGIES/ and depending on your physical state to be aware of your inhaler/medication intake.

I think MEAT IS ACTUALLY AMAZING and very helpful in the Diet (Chicken, Lean Turkey Meatballs, A Thick Omelette). And Today I had 1/3rd of 85% Dark Chocolate and it was about 80% okay, the residue down my throat likely was causing the small amounts of coughing.

So through a recent blood report i came to know my uric acid level is 8.2. Let me tell you straight that I'm not afraid of gout.  Ive been researching a lot about this topic since 3 days. Its been found that only 20 percent of people with high uric acid have gout and its highly genetic. Nobody in my family has gout uptill now. So my chance of gout is pretty low.

Hi everyone !
I need your advice. I'm 21 years old and It's been almost 10 years that I'm a damn vegetable in my daily life. 
It began really really suddenly. I always thought the problem was my stomach but it's been few days that I'm suddenly thinking that it could actually be my bowel.

Here are my main symptoms:

- HUGE pain 24/24h in all my belly (stomach + bowel? Hard to say). Just breathing and talking makes it really painful.
- Spasmophilia like crazy
- My heart sucks. Beating too fast really often.
- Acid reflux a lotttt
- Super tired
- Disgust by food (I always have to watch something to distract me) 
- I never feel hungry and when I begin to eat I need to hurry cause after some time (not depending on how much I eat) I will not be able to eat anymore
- I poo 1 times a week and sometimes like 3 times a day  but Its not like diarrhea and I don't really feel constipated. I mean it's complicated cause it's been like that since I'm 12 years old so for me it's normal. 

Symptomes and pain much worst... :

- after I ate. Like for 3h +-. I can't move from my sofa.
- when I'm standing up or my arms are up.
- when my stomach begin to be empty, I feel really painful.
- when I do cardio/sport.

Indeed I saw a LOT of different doctors, tried a lot of diets, lot of medicine, had a lot of medical exams and stuff. But they never saw anything. The only thing that was weird was a dysbiose but somehow one day she's there, one day she's gone, and one day she's worst . 
I thought it was maybe a candidiasis but now I'm not sure anymore.

I (F/30) was diagnosed with Lupus after almost two years of testing. Originally I saw a hematologist because my platelets were crazy low! Almost at 60 when it should be 300+! The hematologist discovered antibodies in my blood and referred me to a rheumatologist. After two years of blood tests, a sudden allergy to gluten, and awful headaches in the back of my head, they were confident I had lupus. 

I also tested positive for Sjögren's syndrome because my SSA was high but not my SSB. 

I was advised to start Plaquenil even though my symptoms are mild. My symptoms are mostly fatigue, muscle pain, and awful headaches and mental fog after eating gluten (Im assuming gluten causes flare ups ). I also have  
Raynaud's phenomenon. 

I am a fairly active person and strength train 4-5x a week which really helps with the joint and muscle pain. So I will likely continue with that. As well as avoiding gluten!

Hello, I'm seeking advise from anyone who will listen. I'm 37, fit , normal weight

At the start of November I had a really painful throat, so with a fear of covid in mind I think I may have over done it with Paracetamol and Ibuprophen. 

I then started to develope pains in my upper left chest and rib areas, the pains would be in various locations, constant. At first I thought I was having a heart attack, but waking up I could feel acid reflux. 

This has gone on every day for the past 5 weeks, for the last 3 weeks I've watched everything I've ate, only eating bland chicken , bone broth, banana smoothies with almond milk, cabbage and aloe juice.

I went to the doctor 2 weeks ago and I've been on PPI Omeprazole 20mg per day. 

The pains in my chest and side are constant but lesser, now just dull pains, and the acid reflux is still every night.

1. It's unknown if my first sore throat was actually a result of acid reflux to begin with. So it remains unknown if the pain killers affected my stomach.

2. My blood work is perfect, my stool is fine.

3. I won't be able to get a endoscopy or CT scan because I'm on the NHS and it will take months.

My biggest fear is that it's cancer, but I'm hoping if it was my blood would show some sort of markers.

Is it normal for the dull areas of pain to radiate heat? So the spots seem warm to the touch.

If this is gastritis or stomach ulcers, when do you think I should expect healing to occur , if I make sure my current diet stays the same.

Is it normal to wake up with a hot head and ears like a semi fever, that goes away during the day.

Hey guys,

I suffer from what turned out to be IBS basically for 6 years now (28yo). Started as C with no other symptoms than constipation, but during last 2 years due to stress connected with my study it progressed with additional symptoms of nausea and IBS-M. Lately its mainly IBS-D. I will describe my treatments, maybe this will help someone find the right drug. I am managing (kinda) my symptoms with some medications I was working out with my gastrologist - trimebutine/mebeverine + sulpiride (seems to totally alleviate my nausea). I also tried amitriptylline 25mg once daily before sleep - it was kind of wonder drug, because for a week everything came back to normal, but after a month of using it I had to stop, because of my resting HR of 100bpm while on it, and came back to sulpiride 100mg once daily in the morning. I also underwent two Xifaxan treatments, which didnt do much, but it got me to think about the gut microbiota. Lately the diarrhea got so bad for me, I started searching for some other treatments, because my doc couldnt offer anything else. Undergoing medical training myself I know a thing or two about reading scientific papers, and recently, while sh\*\*\*ing my guts out, I stumbled upon few works on microbiota connection with IBS - particularly decreased Bifidobactetium strains in IBS patients. Actually, my gastrologist prescribed me Bifidobacterium infantis once, but honestly I hadnt noticed much difference after taking it for a month. I also watched a few webinars featuring Patrycja Szachta (shes a medical biology PhD. in Poland, very insightful content to see in regards of using and determining probiotics you need, ofc if you understand polish) and decided to give Bifidobacterium a shot once more -  but now I decided to use complex blend with appropriate CFU values, double encapsulated, with prebiotics. I also added supplemental dietary fiber to the mix. Guess what? Diarrhea, already lasting for weeks, transformed into semi-constipation, in the matter of two days - so somethings definitely up. Bifidobacterium use for me wasnt just a blind shot - there was some facts in my medical history that added sense to this - I remember having problems already from mid-school age (but nothing serious), I was born by C-section and for very extended period of time in my infancy I was fed formula instead of maternal milk (my mother lost it due to stress). Due to early-90s reality in Poland it wasnt of course a formula enriched with probiotics - my father got what he could. Going further, in my early years (4-6) I suffered from frequent tonsil infections and I was flooded with antibiotics very frequently, until I had tonsillectomy done. For now I decided to stick with this particular probiotic for 2-3 weeks and to see where it takes me and will report. For sure Ill be getting fecal microbiota analysis. If someone will want it I can post ingredients of this probiotic later.

Cheers

edit: started on 04.02, so this will be **day 4th**. I am still far from believing that this little experiment will fix my problems, because I was let down too many times, but my bowel habits still seem to improve (for this moment I feel ""cured""). Pain that was accompying this semi-constipation I had is mostly gone, and I guess I will report to you guys at the end of the week.

I also watched a few webinars featuring Patrycja Szachta (shes a medical biology PhD. in Poland, very insightful content to see in regards of using and determining probiotics you need, ofc if you understand polish) and decided to give Bifidobacterium a shot once more -  but now I decided to use complex blend with appropriate CFU values, double encapsulated, with prebiotics. I also added supplemental dietary fiber to the mix. Guess what? Diarrhea, already lasting for weeks, transformed into semi-constipation, in the matter of two days - so somethings definitely up. Bifidobacterium use for me wasnt just a blind shot - there was some facts in my medical history that added sense to this - I remember having problems already from mid-school age (but nothing serious), I was born by C-section and for very extended period of time in my infancy I was fed formula instead of maternal milk (my mother lost it due to stress). Due to early-90s reality in Poland it wasnt of course a formula enriched with probiotics - my father got what he could. Going further, in my early years (4-6) I suffered from frequent tonsil infections and I was flooded with antibiotics very frequently, until I had tonsillectomy done. For now I decided to stick with this particular probiotic for 2-3 weeks and to see where it takes me and will report. For sure Ill be getting fecal microbiota analysis. If someone will want it I can post ingredients of this probiotic later.

Cheers

edit: started on 04.02, so this will be **day 4th**. I am still far from believing that this little experiment will fix my problems, because I was let down too many times, but my bowel habits still seem to improve (for this moment I feel ""cured""). Pain that was accompying this semi-constipation I had is mostly gone, and I guess I will report to you guys at the end of the week. Would be nice if new relapse isn't awaiting me already, wouldn't it?

I will also attach my probiotic blend ingredients, so no one has to search in comments:

Bifidobacterium breve BR03 - 4x109 cells

Bifidobacterium animalis lactis BS01 - 3x109 cells

Bifidobacterium bifidum BB01 - 2x109 cells

735,sc675m,t5_2tyg2,"The stigma of taking meds (Open discussion).
Hi, I just wanted to talk about the stigma of taking medication for mental health.

There are so many people out there that just dont understand that sometimes medicine can save lives  or actually being able to diminish the symptoms of a lot of disorders.

I remember when I was living in Italy (2015) and as soon as I mentioned to anyone that I needed to go to a psychiatrist, potentially get a diagnosis and also being prescribed medication people would literally tell me that is was a waste of money and taking meds would literally ruin my life.

When I moved to Florida (where I currently live) in 2019 I finally went to a psychiatrist and got prescribed one medication for anxiety e another one for depression.

They worked really well for me, it really helped me to diminish my symptoms and finally being able to go outside in public.

Fast forward a couple of years and I get diagnosed with ADD and got on Ritalin and it really effected me in a positive way.

I knew people that where on the same medication that I was taking but they didnt have a good reaction to it.

This is to say that people need to understand that just because someone is on medication because of mental illnesses it doesnt mean that they are crazy or not strong enough to deal with their disorders.
 



And actually sometimes that is the last option or the only option for having a better life.

People need to understand that medicine doesnt equal of seeking for legal stuff to use.

Just because its not a medical illness like heath issues, low/high  blood pressure etc. It doesnt mean to minimize the situation when its about medicine for other reasons.

I heard so many comments about medication and there is such a stigma behind it.

The ones that I hear the most are;
Do you really have to be on that medication?

When can you stop taking it?

I would never take stuff like that, I prefer natural remedies like tea, fish oil, supplements

741,rgkzj8,t5_2s1h9,"Feeling crazy
This is my first post after lurking and reading awhile.  Thanks for listening, everyone.

I had my first seizure at 22 and am 38 now.  I've had one abnormal EEG, really early on, that showed abnormal patterns in my left temporal lobe.

Since then?  NOTHING.  No abnormal EEGs.  No lesions, tumors, brain problems of any kind.  And I was pretty fine with that as long as I was functioning reasonably well.  After my third AED, the side effects were so bad I went off them for years.  Probably had 1-2 seizures a year, on average, for most of a decade.  I'd take a couple days off work, sleep it off if I needed too.

Then last winter, I had a seizure that I couldn't shake off, and went back to a new neurologist, who said it was pretty likely I was having a long series of very small seizures and that I really, really needed to go on meds.  So I did, went back to work after a couple of months, made it a couple of months back and the seizures started again.  More stress, I'm a teacher in the middle of covid, so not surprising they start.  They up the dose, and the side effects start - I can't talk, I can't think, I start falling.

They change the meds, I extend my leave from work after falling out my first day back.

This is my first post after lurking and reading awhile.  Thanks for listening, everyone.

I had my first seizure at 22 and am 38 now.  I've had one abnormal EEG, really early on, that showed abnormal patterns in my left temporal lobe.

Since then?  NOTHING.  No abnormal EEGs.  No lesions, tumors, brain problems of any kind.  And I was pretty fine with that as long as I was functioning reasonably well.  After my third AED, the side effects were so bad I went off them for years.  Probably had 1-2 seizures a year, on average, for most of a decade.  I'd take a couple days off work, sleep it off if I needed too.

Then last winter, I had a seizure that I couldn't shake off, and went back to a new neurologist, who said it was pretty likely I was having a long series of very small seizures and that I really, really needed to go on meds.  So I did, went back to work after a couple of months, made it a couple of months back and the seizures started again.  More stress, I'm a teacher in the middle of covid, so not surprising they start.  They up the dose, and the side effects start - I can't talk, I can't think, I start falling.

They change the meds, I extend my leave from work after falling out my first day back.

*Feel free to skip to the bold last part*

I know that for some that's not a word they feel comfortable with, and I get it. I mean it might feel a bit weird to say I am disabled when I don't really feel disabled(especially after Trikafta) and noone can tell(but that's it's someitmes called rhe invisible disability)

So in the country I get treated it is considered a disability (the exact percentage of disability depends on whether your lungs are infected with a bacteria or not).

There are some ""advantages"" for that.

**What I am trying to collect info for:** In that country CF is considered a permanent/non-reversible disability (which means that you only have to get diagnosed once instead of going to a group of ignorant doctors that hardly ever heard of cf to check if you still have the disability, a process kind of humiliating for me)

A new law is being passed in my home country which will stop the unacceptable process of checking some categories of diabled people from having to get a renewal of their disability from a council of doctors every three years(even for cases of amputated people).

Boy have I had a year. 

Tldr: Ive had stomach issues since the top of January and was diagnosed with an H.Pylori infection. Was put on antibiotics and finished treatment a week ago, but Im still not feeling myself. Im wondering if Ive developed IBS from the ordeal. 

The symptoms I've been having recently are - soft stool/diarrhea, exhaustion/fatigue, headaches and occasional chest pain, lots of tummy rumbles, dizziness. It doesnt SEEM to be triggered by food any longer but its hard to tell. Ive been trying to stay fed because Ive lost 10lbs in 8 weeks (Im F 29yo 5 4 and now 120lbs, any more weight loss is gonna get dangerous)

Im lactose intolerant so I dont really eat dairy, and for the duration of being sick I've cut coffee out and am eating lower acidic foods. Ive also been taking probiotics and b12 for about two weeks now, Im not sure if its helping. Ive not taken any over the counter meds since last Saturday because I had been taken painkillers non stop for a month and I dont want to ruin my liver. I also sort of believe in knowing what youre sick with, yaknow? 

Went to urgent care twice and the hospital once before I was diagnosed with this infection and there doesnt seem to be any major organ problems. Just saw a GI specialist and he told me that we have to wait 8 weeks to see if treatment worked which is a miserable amount of time to still be sick with no answers. Im gonna call again next week if nothing improves but Im trying to get a sense for what Im in for and IBS was always on the table. 

Idk just any advice? Did anyone else develop IBS as a result of bacterial treatment? Ive always had a sensitive stomach that I was good at managing but this really has messed me up and its hard to tell whats worth trying. 


P.S. If you wanna see the posts I made about the infection, theyre here with way more details for context, but idk how insightful theyll be at this point.

Hello everyone,

I just got diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis. 

I'm realizing I've probably had it a while, decades maybe, but always attributed my joint pain to cf related chaos. 

But, after having success with trikafta, the joint pain didn't go away and slowly got worse, which was my head's up that something else was going on. A blood test and a visit with a rheumatologist later and I've got this new diagnosis of RA.

I'm frustrated. I feel like I just got to a place where I trusted that trikafta really worked for me and changed my long term health. Now this diagnosis has come out of the blue and with it a whole host of meds and docs... And of course I'm back in the place where I have to be the one to educate and advocate about my cf to specialists who aren't familiar with it and constantly keep my cf team informed about what other teams are doing.

And this is kind of new territory too. Interactions between trikafta and some of these RA drugs aren't well known yet.

To elaborate further on what I mean by light anxiety, I have always got butterfly esque feelings of anxiety whenever Im headed to a social event, work, a job interview, or just anything really. It was never a problem, just something I would describe as light anxiety that would always fade away as soon as Im faced with whatever was making me feel that way. 

Well now, ever since Ive been cursed with my hiatal hernia and GERD, this light anxiety feeling that I get now effects my stomach, and makes me feel extremely ill and gives me the urge to vomit.

The worst part of it all, is that me knowing Im going to be nauseous from my anxiety makes me EVEN MORE anxious, because Im afraid that Im going to embarrass myself and throw up in a public setting, which then makes me even more nauseous, putting me in a real crappy catch 22 situation. 

This is making everything really hard for me. I have been trying to get a new job and I can barely handle sitting through interviews because of this. At my current job, I had to finish my orientation another day because I had to leave early due to my nausea and the fear that I was going to throw up during it.

Hi, Im new to Reddit and to this community. I honestly need some opinions and/or advice on what to do because I cant figure out what Im experiencing. I am a 32yo Female and have been suffering from migraines since my teenage years so those are nothing new for me but maybe for the past 2+ years Ive been experiencing different kinds of migraines that now accompany severe vertigo/dizziness, constantly. I have seen an ENT and a neuro who only said my migraines are bad and nothing they be concerned about. However, 2 weeks ago I was freaked out and decided I definitely needed to do something about this when I had to pull over on my way to work. I had a vertigo episode that blurred and doubled my vision at the same time and I honestly thought I was going to get into a car accident. I pulled over and let it pass and went to work but I felt like complete crap. I had my co worker drive me to the nearest ER and after a 5 hour wait in the lobby (due to COVID surge) I was finally evaluated by a neuro team and they did say my symptoms point to possible MS. They immediately took me in for a CT and MRI scans but those scans came back normal. Blood work also normal. I was still admitted and they gave me a cocktail of meds. The last cocktail they gave me contained boric acid and prochlorpezaine which broke my headache cycle but not my dizziness. I eventually got discharged upon my request a day early because I was extremely anxious and was in a room with 6 other patients with different conditions and I couldnt do it anymore. They told me to follow up with a neuro but that neuro cant see me for another 2 months in March. Luckily, I had already made a neuro appt 3 months ago before this last episode and my appt is finally tomorrow through FaceTime. I dont want me symptoms to be dismissed. Its been 2 years and Im getting worse. Now I have this burning sensation on my left knee that I wasnt experiencing before as well as swelling of my feet and a tightness feeling. I hate googling things but I dont know much about MS and I want to become more educated.

770,srtnup,t5_2r876,"CFRD; Hypo treatment. What's the best, highest g sugar, most compact treatment option?
Aloha Everyone! I have a question in regards to Diabetes & hypoglycemia treatment.

So, as I have gastroparesis, glucose tabs don't really work that well for me. They take over a half hour to kick in, and I end up overtreating and just go high later on. So I have to drink liquid to treat. Another thing is that I need atleast 40g sugar to treat. So I'm having issues finding compact ways to bring treatment around with me. I normally bring along 2 juice boxes, but I'm want to be wearing a purse instead of a backpack. And I find it hard to save space especially having to carry around glucometer, enzymes and 2 juice boxes. And also glucagon. It's to crammed and can get rather heavy.


Possibly I could make really concentrated sugar water, say 1oz water to 40g sugar, but how would I store that in my bag? And how long would that keep before it goes rancid?


I've looked into those dex glucose liquids, but I would need to have 3 on me at all times, and that seems it would take up the same amount of space as 2 juice boxes already does. Plus they're expensive compared to juice boxes, or home made sugar water.



So my question is what can I bring along with me that had the most g sugar, and is compact, and at the same time will not go rancid quickly?



What's your experience?

So, I've had insane, random migraines my entire life (runs in the family with all the women on my mums side...despite me being a guy)...like really bad ones; burst blood vessels in my eyes and nose bleeds from the pressure, loss of consciousness and drooling - but its only in the past 4 years in which the pain gets so much I black out from it and wake up in A&E to be told I've had multiple seizures.

If I'm able to get on top of the migraine before it progresses  I am able to offset it (i.e. meds and sitting in a dark room all day with my eyes closed trying my hardest to ignore the feeling that someone is pushing their thumbs into my eyeballs). However, the pain is what causes the seizures (I've been told, and is what I assume is happening (as I've ONLY ever had seizures during a migraine)) - but the pain relief they give me is literally not enough - even a doctor/consultant I work with says so. Problem is, every time I talk to the neurologists they insist ""codeine wont help much"" (although I know it does, I've taken large doses whilst in the mist of one and it seriously helps with the recovery from pain, and so I'm able to go back to my day quicker).What should I do/suggest, I have a meeting with them tomorrow ?

786,ryoubg,t5_2s1h9,"Should I go back to my college dorm...?
Hello all,

Recently, I (21F) got diagnosed with focal epilepsy after a partial seizure. It started as muscles violently contracting in my thumb and ended in me being passed out for 3 minutes. No convulsing while passed out, but my eyes were rolled back, I was pale, and my breathing was very shallow (idk if any of this matters). I believe I ended up getting diagnosed because a month earlier I had a fit in my hand but it ended and I did not pass out. I guess that would be considered a seizure just without losing awareness, so I've technically had 2? I'm new to all of this and was very flustered during my first apt. with my neurologist to ask these questions.

So, after telling my neurologist these details, she made it very clear to me that she thinks I should return to college and not let this interfere with my life or plans. Just cut out things like alcohol and drugs and continue on. My issue is that I see mixed viewpoints on the internet regarding similar posts. I'm currently on Keppra 750 mg but I'm slowly changing over to Vimpat by adding 50 mg to the Keppra and waiting a month, adding more Vimpat and lessening the Keppra, and so on. I'm an absolute monster on keppra and it makes my anxiety worse which is why im switching. I guess the unknown is what is scaring me the most... My neurologist said maybe the seizures will be completely controlled, maybe slightly, maybe they'll never happen again, maybe they will, but we can't no for sure so there's no point in worrying.... but I'm worried.

I'm definitley rambling at this point. If you were in my shoes, would you stay at home with your parents for a single semester to figure out the severity of your epilepsy/if the meds even work for you, or would you go back? I can take classes online. I know this is ultimately my decision, but I'd appreciate honest advice from people who know what it's like.",claim_per_exp,I'm an absolute monster on keppra and it makes my anxiety worse which is why im switching,1195,1284,89,(S (NP (PRP I)) (VP (VBP 'm) (NP (NP (DT an) (JJ absolute) (NN monster)) (PP (IN on) (NP (NN keppra)))))),S,1

Is there an ADHD med I can be on? Does weed help? (I hope it does cause I love it).

TLDR: With lots of patience, strict adherence to diet, lifestyle modification and medication, time will heal your LPR, albeit at a very slow rate.


[Update after 2 months since this post: I took 20mg of omeprazole every other morning for 3 weeks and I stop taking it after that. Feel a bit of tingling sensation in my neck every time I reduced the dosage but the sensation went off after a while. My diet is back to pre LPR, I eat everything now including what was impossible just a few months ago such as tomatoes, pasta, pizzas and salad with vinegar dressing. Coffee and chocolate has no effect on me as well. Occasionally I do get some slight sensation coming back so I will take Gaviscon occasionally and the sensation will disappear the next day. Obviously I still stick to good habits such as avoid overeating, eat way less carbs, no lying down after meals for at least 3 hours, no fizzy drinks or sodas . I must say life is a good as it gets now]

Late 30s and non smoker and occasional alcohol.I started having LPR symptoms back in April 2021 such as globus sensation, feeling of a tight neck, burning throat and back of the mouth. By end April 2021, the symptoms were at its worst with heartburn feeling on the worst days. For the 1st 3 months from May to July, the symptoms were getting better though the healing was painfully slow but its more of a roller coaster ride with ups and downs. By August, my symptoms of were much improved though I accidentally ate some trigger food that took me 2-3 weeks to recover after each episode. By October, I was mostly symptom free and I started to wean off omeprazole evening dose in November. Currently, i am only taking 20mg omeprazole every 2 days and is still staying symptom free though if I eat too much of a trigger food, some mild symptoms will come back for a day. I believe I will need another 2 months for a full recovery.

I did the following interventions.

Acid Watcher Diet: After reading Dr Jamie Koufman and Dr Jonathan Avivs books, I figured my LPR was due to downing too many bottles of yogurt drink and iced tea throughout the day for the past 2 years. These iced tea are acidified with citric acid so I  avoid them totally now. For my diet, I eliminated coffee, sodas, chocolate, citrus foods, tomatoes, grapes, berries, vinegar for the past few months. Interestingly, spicy food, cooked garlic and onion has no trigger effect on me. Tomatoes is the worst culprit. I ate a tomato stew and the symptoms came back immediately when I was in the midst of the recovery phase. I bought a alkaline water pitcher and tested the pH to be above 9 and has been drinking only alkaline water since then. I want to stress that during the initial recovery, there is no shortcut to the diet, u need to stick to it. If u cheat, the symptoms will come back and it will delay your healing by a week or two easily as there was how long it takes for the symptoms to go after I ate a trigger food.

Medication: I took 2 doses of 20mg omeprazole everyday for 6 months before I started to wean off slowly last month. I cant say I notice any significant effect on myself but I prefer to take this since it is just temporary for half a year. I switch to rabeprazole halfway for 2 weeks and I got symptomatic relief but it was too expensive to eat this for 6 months so I switched back to omeprazole. I know many mention that taking this has long term side effects but I feel taking it for 6 months is absolutely alright since the benefit outweigh the risk by making the reflux less acidic, giving your esophagus and throat a chance to heal. If I have to take this for more than a year or lifetime, I will hesitate.

In addition, I also took Gaviscon Advance in addition to omeprazole if my symptoms were really bad These days, I will take 5ml at night before I sleep as I notice I will wake up with a sore throat if I dun take it. Planning to wean off in the months to come. I also tried to make my own Gaviscon by mixing alginate, sodium carbonate and potassium bicarbonate and it works as well as I tested it by pouring into a cup of vinegar. It formed a mesh thick layer that floated on top of the vinegar, similar as well when I pour the same amount of Gaviscon to the vinegar. The homemade version is definitely way cheaper but it can be a hassle to make it since u need to weigh the powders and give it a good stir with water before you drink it.

Lifestyle: I eat a smaller meal and eat a lot less carbohydrates these days such as rice, bread and pasta since it cause bloatedness. I realise the symptoms tend to come back if I am bloated. I actually dun have snacks or smaller meals in between, contrary to popular advice of having frequent smaller meals. If I eat more frequently, I tend to more more symptoms. And I chew my food a lot more as compared to before I have LPR. The more digested the food is, the less time it will spent in the stomach.

In order to relieve bloatedness, I usually go for a walk after meals and drink ginger tea. Both relieve bloatedness and increase motility. The faster my food gets digested, the less symptomatic I will get as my symptoms tend to flare up after meals.

I practiced diaphragmatic breathing as well. It helps relieve bloatedness as I fart a lot during breathing. Better for the gas to come out from the other bottom end den through top end, affecting your throat.

Another important thing is I dont ever lie down after any of my meals for at least 3 hours. You wouldnt want your digestive content to back flow.

iQoro: This medical device is expensive but I was getting kind of desperate with my symptoms when it was at its worst so this is more of Hail Mary attempt. Well, the device is easy to use, customer support is very helpful and I read the journal studies that compare between 2 groups of persistent LPR folks which one group use this device as compared to the control group and the results were significantly so I think it is worth a try. 

Acupuncture: Another desperate Hail Mary attempt. I did 2 sessions of acupuncture towards in October but I was getting better already and acupuncture does take some time to take effect based on journal studies so cant really comment if it works for me.

Transnasal Esophagoscopy: This is a endoscopy that is done by the ENT usually. It goes through your nose so it avoids the gag reflex and goes all the way to the stomach. I did mine in the ENT office, sitting on a chair with no sedation, fully conscious and it took 10 mins for the procedure to be completed. The ENT then briefed me on the findings after that and I could drive home immediately. I did this procedure as compared to the usual upper GI endoscopy had the gastroenterologist as the one I consulted did not want to to do this since I am of a low risk profile. In addition the upper GI endoscopy requires sedation, which has a slightly higher risk and I will need someone to take me home after the procedure.

I recommend to get it done ASAP as it gives you a peace of mind. I delayed mine for a while as I dun think I can deal with the small chance of finding out I have cancer or Barrett oesophagus. As my symptoms got worse, it really torment my mind with the nagging fear if I have something beside LPR. Finally, I decide to wing it and did the scope. Thankfully, the ENT didnt find anything significant and he told me I didnt have hiatus hernia and my lower esophageal spincter is tight as well as he showed me a picture of it wrapping tightly around the endoscope. After the procedure is done, I think I felt a lot better for my mental state since I can tell myself that there is nothing seriously wrong with me and I just need patience for the healing to complete.

The homemade version is definitely way cheaper but it can be a hassle to make it since u need to weigh the powders and give it a good stir with water before you drink it.

Lifestyle: I eat a smaller meal and eat a lot less carbohydrates these days such as rice, bread and pasta since it cause bloatedness. I realise the symptoms tend to come back if I am bloated. I actually dun have snacks or smaller meals in between, contrary to popular advice of having frequent smaller meals. If I eat more frequently, I tend to more more symptoms. And I chew my food a lot more as compared to before I have LPR. The more digested the food is, the less time it will spent in the stomach.

In order to relieve bloatedness, I usually go for a walk after meals and drink ginger tea. Both relieve bloatedness and increase motility. The faster my food gets digested, the less symptomatic I will get as my symptoms tend to flare up after meals.

I practiced diaphragmatic breathing as well. It helps relieve bloatedness as I fart a lot during breathing. Better for the gas to come out from the other bottom end den through top end, affecting your throat.

Another important thing is I dont ever lie down after any of my meals for at least 3 hours. You wouldnt want your digestive content to back flow.

[Update after 2 months since this post: I took 20mg of omeprazole every other morning for 3 weeks and I stop taking it after that. Feel a bit of tingling sensation in my neck every time I reduced the dosage but the sensation went off after a while. My diet is back to pre LPR, I eat everything now including what was impossible just a few months ago such as tomatoes, pasta, pizzas and salad with vinegar dressing. Coffee and chocolate has no effect on me as well. Occasionally I do get some slight sensation coming back so I will take Gaviscon occasionally and the sensation will disappear the next day. Obviously I still stick to good habits such as avoid overeating, eat way less carbs, no lying down after meals for at least 3 hours, no fizzy drinks or sodas . I must say life is a good as it gets now]

Late 30s and non smoker and occasional alcohol.I started having LPR symptoms back in April 2021 such as globus sensation, feeling of a tight neck, burning throat and back of the mouth. By end April 2021, the symptoms were at its worst with heartburn feeling on the worst days. For the 1st 3 months from May to July, the symptoms were getting better though the healing was painfully slow but its more of a roller coaster ride with ups and downs. By August, my symptoms of were much improved though I accidentally ate some trigger food that took me 2-3 weeks to recover after each episode. By October, I was mostly symptom free and I started to wean off omeprazole evening dose in November. Currently, i am only taking 20mg omeprazole every 2 days and is still staying symptom free though if I eat too much of a trigger food, some mild symptoms will come back for a day. I believe I will need another 2 months for a full recovery.

I did the following interventions.

Acid Watcher Diet: After reading Dr Jamie Koufman and Dr Jonathan Avivs books, I figured my LPR was due to downing too many bottles of yogurt drink and iced tea throughout the day for the past 2 years. These iced tea are acidified with citric acid so I  avoid them totally now. For my diet, I eliminated coffee, sodas, chocolate, citrus foods, tomatoes, grapes, berries, vinegar for the past few months. Interestingly, spicy food, cooked garlic and onion has no trigger effect on me. Tomatoes is the worst culprit. I ate a tomato stew and the symptoms came back immediately when I was in the midst of the recovery phase. I bought a alkaline water pitcher and tested the pH to be above 9 and has been drinking only alkaline water since then. I want to stress that during the initial recovery, there is no shortcut to the diet, u need to stick to it. If u cheat, the symptoms will come back and it will delay your healing by a week or two easily as there was how long it takes for the symptoms to go after I ate a trigger food.

Medication: I took 2 doses of 20mg omeprazole everyday for 6 months before I started to wean off slowly last month. I cant say I notice any significant effect on myself but I prefer to take this since it is just temporary for half a year. I switch to rabeprazole halfway for 2 weeks and I got symptomatic relief but it was too expensive to eat this for 6 months so I switched back to omeprazole. I know many mention that taking this has long term side effects but I feel taking it for 6 months is absolutely alright since the benefit outweigh the risk by making the reflux less acidic, giving your esophagus and throat a chance to heal. If I have to take this for more than a year or lifetime, I will hesitate.

In addition, I also took Gaviscon Advance in addition to omeprazole if my symptoms were really bad These days, I will take 5ml at night before I sleep as I notice I will wake up with a sore throat if I dun take it. Planning to wean off in the months to come. I also tried to make my own Gaviscon by mixing alginate, sodium carbonate and potassium bicarbonate and it works as well as I tested it by pouring into a cup of vinegar.

Medication: I took 2 doses of 20mg omeprazole everyday for 6 months before I started to wean off slowly last month. I cant say I notice any significant effect on myself but I prefer to take this since it is just temporary for half a year. I switch to rabeprazole halfway for 2 weeks and I got symptomatic relief but it was too expensive to eat this for 6 months so I switched back to omeprazole. I know many mention that taking this has long term side effects but I feel taking it for 6 months is absolutely alright since the benefit outweigh the risk by making the reflux less acidic, giving your esophagus and throat a chance to heal. If I have to take this for more than a year or lifetime, I will hesitate.

In addition, I also took Gaviscon Advance in addition to omeprazole if my symptoms were really bad These days, I will take 5ml at night before I sleep as I notice I will wake up with a sore throat if I dun take it. Planning to wean off in the months to come. I also tried to make my own Gaviscon by mixing alginate, sodium carbonate and potassium bicarbonate and it works as well as I tested it by pouring into a cup of vinegar. It formed a mesh thick layer that floated on top of the vinegar, similar as well when I pour the same amount of Gaviscon to the vinegar. The homemade version is definitely way cheaper but it can be a hassle to make it since u need to weigh the powders and give it a good stir with water before you drink it.

Lifestyle: I eat a smaller meal and eat a lot less carbohydrates these days such as rice, bread and pasta since it cause bloatedness. I realise the symptoms tend to come back if I am bloated. I actually dun have snacks or smaller meals in between, contrary to popular advice of having frequent smaller meals. If I eat more frequently, I tend to more more symptoms. And I chew my food a lot more as compared to before I have LPR. The more digested the food is, the less time it will spent in the stomach.

In order to relieve bloatedness, I usually go for a walk after meals and drink ginger tea. Both relieve bloatedness and increase motility. The faster my food gets digested, the less symptomatic I will get as my symptoms tend to flare up after meals.

I practiced diaphragmatic breathing as well. It helps relieve bloatedness as I fart a lot during breathing. Better for the gas to come out from the other bottom end den through top end, affecting your throat.

Another important thing is I dont ever lie down after any of my meals for at least 3 hours. You wouldnt want your digestive content to back flow.

iQoro: This medical device is expensive but I was getting kind of desperate with my symptoms when it was at its worst so this is more of Hail Mary attempt. Well, the device is easy to use, customer support is very helpful and I read the journal studies that compare between 2 groups of persistent LPR folks which one group use this device as compared to the control group and the results were significantly so I think it is worth a try. 

Acupuncture: Another desperate Hail Mary attempt. I did 2 sessions of acupuncture towards in October but I was getting better already and acupuncture does take some time to take effect based on journal studies so cant really comment if it works for me.

Transnasal Esophagoscopy: This is a endoscopy that is done by the ENT usually. It goes through your nose so it avoids the gag reflex and goes all the way to the stomach. I did mine in the ENT office, sitting on a chair with no sedation, fully conscious and it took 10 mins for the procedure to be completed. The ENT then briefed me on the findings after that and I could drive home immediately. I did this procedure as compared to the usual upper GI endoscopy had the gastroenterologist as the one I consulted did not want to to do this since I am of a low risk profile. In addition the upper GI endoscopy requires sedation, which has a slightly higher risk and I will need someone to take me home after the procedure.

I recommend to get it done ASAP as it gives you a peace of mind. I delayed mine for a while as I dun think I can deal with the small chance of finding out I have cancer or Barrett oesophagus. As my symptoms got worse, it really torment my mind with the nagging fear if I have something beside LPR. Finally, I decide to wing it and did the scope. Thankfully, the ENT didnt find anything significant and he told me I didnt have hiatus hernia and my lower esophageal spincter is tight as well as he showed me a picture of it wrapping tightly around the endoscope. After the procedure is done, I think I felt a lot better for my mental state since I can tell myself that there is nothing seriously wrong with me and I just need patience for the healing to complete.

TLDR: With lots of patience, strict adherence to diet, lifestyle modification and medication, time will heal your LPR, albeit at a very slow rate.


[Update after 2 months since this post: I took 20mg of omeprazole every other morning for 3 weeks and I stop taking it after that. Feel a bit of tingling sensation in my neck every time I reduced the dosage but the sensation went off after a while. My diet is back to pre LPR, I eat everything now including what was impossible just a few months ago such as tomatoes, pasta, pizzas and salad with vinegar dressing. Coffee and chocolate has no effect on me as well. Occasionally I do get some slight sensation coming back so I will take Gaviscon occasionally and the sensation will disappear the next day. Obviously I still stick to good habits such as avoid overeating, eat way less carbs, no lying down after meals for at least 3 hours, no fizzy drinks or sodas . I must say life is a good as it gets now]

Late 30s and non smoker and occasional alcohol.I started having LPR symptoms back in April 2021 such as globus sensation, feeling of a tight neck, burning throat and back of the mouth. By end April 2021, the symptoms were at its worst with heartburn feeling on the worst days. For the 1st 3 months from May to July, the symptoms were getting better though the healing was painfully slow but its more of a roller coaster ride with ups and downs. By August, my symptoms of were much improved though I accidentally ate some trigger food that took me 2-3 weeks to recover after each episode. By October, I was mostly symptom free and I started to wean off omeprazole evening dose in November. Currently, i am only taking 20mg omeprazole every 2 days and is still staying symptom free though if I eat too much of a trigger food, some mild symptoms will come back for a day. I believe I will need another 2 months for a full recovery.

I did the following interventions.

Acid Watcher Diet: After reading Dr Jamie Koufman and Dr Jonathan Avivs books, I figured my LPR was due to downing too many bottles of yogurt drink and iced tea throughout the day for the past 2 years. These iced tea are acidified with citric acid so I  avoid them totally now. For my diet, I eliminated coffee, sodas, chocolate, citrus foods, tomatoes, grapes, berries, vinegar for the past few months. Interestingly, spicy food, cooked garlic and onion has no trigger effect on me. Tomatoes is the worst culprit. I ate a tomato stew and the symptoms came back immediately when I was in the midst of the recovery phase. I bought a alkaline water pitcher and tested the pH to be above 9 and has been drinking only alkaline water since then. I want to stress that during the initial recovery, there is no shortcut to the diet, u need to stick to it. If u cheat, the symptoms will come back and it will delay your healing by a week or two easily as there was how long it takes for the symptoms to go after I ate a trigger food.

My husband was diagnosed back at the end of 2019. One of his main symptoms is head pressure, and was initially diagnosed with 4 lesions in his brain and a cluster in his thoracic spine but there hasnt been any increase in number of lesions since hes been diagnosed. 

Hes received an ultrasound on his neck veins and arteries, and saw like many others with MS, the vein on the left side of his neck, coming down and out of his brain back to the heart, was significantly smaller and had webbing in it as compared to the major artery on the right side leading to the brain. 

One way weve found to relieve his head pressure he feels is literally me massaging his neck where his veins and arteries are located. The most difference is made by massaging the smaller vein. He says he feels instant relief and often feels a tingling sensation over his entire body like his body is waking up. He also says it feels like the flow is back and a flushing like experience in his brain. 

I know it sounds insane, but believe me when I say he is weirdly very attuned with his body and the sensations he feels. Afterwards other symptoms, such as walking mobility and overall coordination literally goes back to normal. It takes a couple of hours for the head pressure to come back which is synonymous with the other symptoms reappearing. 

Is this something any one else experiences? Are there other ways to help relieve the head pressure? What is the cause of this?",claim_per_exp,"

Just for clarity I don't have GERD, but this subreddit helped me so much in my search for information about endoscopy procedures. I wanted to come here and share my experience in the hopes that more people will see this post and know it will be okay. 


I was working on checking off all my pre-op appointments and tests I thought I would post my story so that anyone searching Reddit (like I've been for two weeks) for endoscopy stories might come upon this.

I was terrified. I was convinced I would never wake up. I was in unable to sleep without nightmares this week and not at all last night. I'm a woman, 32, and since I'm getting weight loss surgery, obviously overweight. 

When I got to the surgery center, I was asked  about my medication, COVID exposure, and any symptoms I might be feeling (pain, nausea, headache, etc), my blood pressure and weight were taken, and I got into my gown which just went over my clothes.

I went into the surgery room and signed papers for anesthesia consent then met the team, and got on the bed, which took me a minute because I did NOT want to. 

I got my IV placed and talked for a few minutes while I got into position, which was on my left side, right knee bent and touching the bed, left leg straight. I got a mouth guard with a hole in it to keep my mouth open.  The anesthesiologist, who was great, told me that I would feel a little stinging from the meds and honestly I prepared to never wake up again. 

I remember my head feeling very tingly, then that was it. I woke up in recovery with my limbs feeling really heavy for a few minutes, but overall fine!

I was so relieved and everything went really well! I got some some juice and my husband took me home. I got this procedure on 12/10/21 at 11:30 am and originally posted to a WLS subreddit by 2:17 pm. My throat is a little sore but it doesn't feel like when you're sick it's a little bit lower, mostly because, well, I've never had a camera down my gullet  I had a bit of an allergic reaction hours later, a few hives and itching, but nothing Zyrtec couldn't take care of.

806,rzis3f,t5_2qlaa,"Does GERD cause lightheadedness?
I'm wanting to get a better understanding of what's going on with me since my doctor is all out of ideas after doing a full workup. If it wasn't for the fact that my doctors don't know what to do with me from here, I wouldn't be asking reddit for advice, but here I am. Everything we've ruled out is Diabetes, Hypoglycemia, Thyroid issues, Anemia, Adrenal Issues, did an endoscopy, celiac, h- pilori, IBS, gastritis, hyperlipidemia, vitamin d deficiency, electrolyte levels, kidney/liver disease, and heart issues. 

I think I might have GERD, but I don't know if it would cause lightheadedness / dizziness. I also have other stuff that you would think would make GERD worse, but in fact helps (such as wearing a corset or something else very tightly around the waist or holding a pillow to my stomach helps ease the stomach pain, and chewing gum makes things much worse even though articles online say the saliva formed helps ease symptoms) 

The thing is, my understanding of heartburn has been that it's like an isolated symptom of the burning feeling up your esophagus, and it wouldn't trigger lightheadedness / dizziness. It seems like avoiding certain triggers does seem to help, like I had to stop eating spaghetti and meatballs because of the high carb pasta and the acidity from the tomatoes. 

I deal with frequent hunger that feels like a sharp/acidic gnawing pain behind my sternum that makes me want to curl into a ball/guard my stomach, I get gurgling in the back of my throat and the nerves down my arms to my fingers start buzzing. Smoking weed also makes this acidic feeling / lightheadedness much worse and lead to me fainting at one point so I ended up having to unfortunately stop smoking weed. Does this happen for y'all too? Like, you can't let yourself get hungry or your stomach gets really acidic? 

These symptoms get worse when I eat something loaded with carbs like candy or fruit or a bagel. I even have troubles with eating a salad on an empty stomach. 

They get better when I make sure to eat something low carb + protein filled with some fats, like chicken and brussel sprouts. Or if I eat a massive amount at one point, like a chipotle burrito bowl will keep the symptoms at bay for a few hours. I can't go more than a couple of hours without eating unless I eat a giant portion, and even then depending on what I eat like if it's a bread / berries / nuts / cheese charcuterie board I will need to eat something in like 30 minutes. 

I'm just not sure what to do, because it seems like for GERD you're told to avoid fats, but carbs also spike my symptoms too, so it's like I'm just left with protein and that doesn't fill me up on its own.

807,rzis3f,t5_2qlaa,"Does GERD cause lightheadedness?
I'm wanting to get a better understanding of what's going on with me since my doctor is all out of ideas after doing a full workup. If it wasn't for the fact that my doctors don't know what to do with me from here, I wouldn't be asking reddit for advice, but here I am. Everything we've ruled out is Diabetes, Hypoglycemia, Thyroid issues, Anemia, Adrenal Issues, did an endoscopy, celiac, h- pilori, IBS, gastritis, hyperlipidemia, vitamin d deficiency, electrolyte levels, kidney/liver disease, and heart issues. 

I think I might have GERD, but I don't know if it would cause lightheadedness / dizziness. I also have other stuff that you would think would make GERD worse, but in fact helps (such as wearing a corset or something else very tightly around the waist or holding a pillow to my stomach helps ease the stomach pain, and chewing gum makes things much worse even though articles online say the saliva formed helps ease symptoms) 

The thing is, my understanding of heartburn has been that it's like an isolated symptom of the burning feeling up your esophagus, and it wouldn't trigger lightheadedness / dizziness. It seems like avoiding certain triggers does seem to help, like I had to stop eating spaghetti and meatballs because of the high carb pasta and the acidity from the tomatoes. 

I deal with frequent hunger that feels like a sharp/acidic gnawing pain behind my sternum that makes me want to curl into a ball/guard my stomach, I get gurgling in the back of my throat and the nerves down my arms to my fingers start buzzing. Smoking weed also makes this acidic feeling / lightheadedness much worse and lead to me fainting at one point so I ended up having to unfortunately stop smoking weed. Does this happen for y'all too? Like, you can't let yourself get hungry or your stomach gets really acidic? 

These symptoms get worse when I eat something loaded with carbs like candy or fruit or a bagel. I even have troubles with eating a salad on an empty stomach. 

They get better when I make sure to eat something low carb + protein filled with some fats, like chicken and brussel sprouts. Or if I eat a massive amount at one point, like a chipotle burrito bowl will keep the symptoms at bay for a few hours. I can't go more than a couple of hours without eating unless I eat a giant portion, and even then depending on what I eat like if it's a bread / berries / nuts / cheese charcuterie board I will need to eat something in like 30 minutes. 

I'm just not sure what to do, because it seems like for GERD you're told to avoid fats, but carbs also spike my symptoms too, so it's like I'm just left with protein and that doesn't fill me up on its own. The other day I tried having an ultra GERD friendly breakfast of oatmeal and whey isolate to get like 25 / 30g of protein and even then I was really hungry in less than an hour and I think it's because without the fats my body couldn't really absorb the protein powder or something.

So my problem is that I have a bloated stomach all the time. I would probably say 2/3 of my time other than sleep time is very painful. I'm pretty sure it has everything to do with my anxiety and unstoppable chaotic thinkings in my mind. And I have been having this for 7 years.

A couple of months ago I downloaded a game called Stardew Valley. This game has eased my mind a lot. I'm not saying it's a relaxing game as it can be intense if you want to achieve certain goals in the game. But basically what I did was that I would play 1.5 hour before going to bed. And it worked EVERY TIME. I think the idea is to find something that can easily occupy your mind, and this game Stardew Valley happens to be one of those things. 

&#x200B;

After I feel a good relief on my stomach. I will go to bed immediately because if not I would probably have something going on in my head again, which led the gas to come back again.

810,rymjee,t5_2qlaa,"Why does excessive burping mean GERD?
I went to my doctor as I've been burping air a lot for the past three months. I burp when I drink water, I burp when my stomach is empty, and basically all day. This all started on the 26th of September. On the 24th of September I swallowed a piece of bread to hard and developed a clicking throat. Which means the muscles were clicking whenever I swallowed saliva or food. I got scared to swallow because of this, and started to swallow differently, like more convulsive. And I chew every small bite, untill there is basically nothing left to swallow and my jaw is tired. Two days later the burping and gurgling and rumbling started in my throat and esophagus and stomach. I wasn't worried about it, as I thought this was caused by me swallowing the wrong way. So I believed it was caused by anxiety and aerophagia. 

The clicking sensation in my throat thankfully went away slowly after like two months. And so did the burping and rumbling. But whenever I eat I'm still terrified. I'm worried that my throat will click again, or that food will end up in my windpipe. And I still take small bites and keep chewing untill there is basically nothing left to swallow, so the burping returned, but this time I also got a tickle in my throat and developed a sore throat and a bad taste. This is why I decided to go to the doctor. The second I mentioned excessive burping I got diagnosed with acid reflux. The doctor prescribed Famotidine, which I have to take for 6 weeks, twice every day. I did not believe this. I honestly believe I have aerophagia, but my throat issues seem more like acid or silent reflux symptoms. 

After two weeks, I was still burping, so returned to the doctor. He simply told me to continue with Famotidine for another 4 weeks. He's convinced that it's acid reflux, which will go away after another month of taking Famotidine. According to the doctor lifestyle changes aren't necessary and he clearly doesn't seem to think that acid reflux is a big deal. He even laughed in my face when I called this a chronic disease and horrific diagnosis. 

It's been 3 weeks now, Famotidine is still not helping me. SO the question is: Is this really acid reflux caused by some sphincter malfunction? Why can't it be: 

Burping because of anxiety and aerophagia
Considering I burp so much, it obviously irritates my throat
And for sure all the burping causes a little bit of acid to reflux up all the way into my throat 

So if I got rid of the burping, the acid reflux and throat issues would also go away? 

Why can't this be possible?

Hello IBS members,

Just wanted ask a few questions regarding my symptoms over the past 7-8 months. It all began with constant basing of the stomach and dizziness. Fortunately that subsided over time. Continuing with that has been nausea, diarrhea, yellow clear mucus stools that seem to smell fishy. Otherwise stools dont have any smell anymore.

Although the being diagnosed is nice it doesnt help. I believe I have something greater than that. I just dont know what it is and it makes it really difficult to cope with the idea that I have no idea what I have but feel uncomfortable.

My seizures usually started half and hour into sleep. I was started on Clobazam . Got 8 seizures in 2002 and 2 in 2004. 

Eventually I was started on Keppra in 06. Since then I had no seizure until in May 2018 due to my schedule I often forgot to take meds. In May 2018, I had a tonic clonic. After which my Keppra was increased from 500/day to 750/day. Now I am seizure free. Been driving motorbike for 5 years now.

**The official diagnosis is Bilateral Tonic Clonic seizures due to neonatal sepsis**

The side effects that I have are :

Anxiety with depressive features

Irritability

So, yeah, that's basically it. I thought i had a full bag of Risperidone (3 mg) boxes, that I've been taking for 4 years, but it turns out, they ran out! I still took my Prometazine (25 mg) and Quetiapine (25 mg), but didn't have any Risperidone. I went to sleep and forgot about it when I woke up.  


I ended up not acting so good in a situation online and some people were mad at how I was acting, but I just ignored it, because I had more important things to do.  


So, hours later I was talking with my friend about mental health and I talked about me medicine, so it hit me, I didn't take it the night before, so it's pretty possible that I was acting the way I did because of it.  


I know this because it had happened before. When I didn't take my medicine I ended up acting in bad ways.  


Another thing that I noticed is that I was feeling really awful, but I remembered this feeling. Everytime I didn't sleep and was awake for more than one day I felt that way.   


Also, everytime I didn't sleep, I also didn't take my medicine, because I wanted to stay awake and the medicine makes me sleepy.  


So then I noticed, I was feeling the same things, but I actually had slept. The bad feeling I felt before when I stayed awake wasn't because I was tired, as I always thought, it probably was symptoms of withdrawal.  


And yeah, that's how I'm feeling right now, really bad. My body is really strange. I feel weak and my body has a really strange sensation.  


Also, before I started taking medicine I noticed I didn't have any hangovers after drinking.  


Some years after I started taking pills, when I drank I also didn't take my medicine, and after I wake up the other day I was feeling really bad. Now I notice that it's the same feeling I'm feeling right now, so I probably wasn't feeling hungover, I was just having withdrawal symptoms...  


Well, that's it! I'll try to get more pills as soon as possible, but I probably should stay away from the internet for some days until I take my pills so I don't do something stupid because I know my mental helth will decline for those next days I don't take my risperidone.

I was actually first diagnosed with Diabetes type 1 around 4 or 5 years old then around 10 i got the table test and was re-diagnosed with Hypoglycemic induced POTS. In my mind I just had to deal with both salt and sugar lmao. It was told to me that I may slowly grow out of this but as of lately its just been getting worse so Ive just come to terms with living with it. Ive always been in good physical shape, slightly skinny but I also just have a basketball/long distance runner type shape. 

Im now almost 20 years old, 6, and 140 pounds. Ive been trying to survive in one of the hardest colleges for my engineering major during covid. Which has added some descent ADHD and severe Anxiety to my lineup(knew I had before but was easy enough to deal with) with everything combined has totally ramped up my pots. 

My heart rate regularly hits 200 bpm or higher when doing certain exercises that shouldnt warrant it and even will hover around 145 during 4 hour long exams. Hot weather also is a death sentence for me. To give some reference my resting heart rate (not on my adhd meds) is normally 50 or lower. Standing will jump it to around 100 or 120 or so depending on how long Im sitting down. I get extreme migraine above my eyes when I have flair ups. I do have a very healthy sleep as of lately. I do have slow deteriorating vision and I regularly go blind few times throughout the day when standing up for about 10 seconds. 

While I do have accommodations from
my college. They typically dont equal the playing field from me and my peers and never will. Sitting in a chair in a hot room forced to solve timed problems is the worst way to see how smart I am at something. Ive even passed out during exams and had to get EMS to clear me. I had to fight with a professor to not count my 30%grade and even required proof that the EMS came to the disability center. I still failed the class and I was guaranteed to as 90% of
grades were the exams. Flair ups for me equate to 24 hours of extra time to
finish an assignment. While its helpful it also sets me up to fail on everything else thats due soon after and many times 24hours isnt enough for me to recover. 

Any tips you may think will be helpful and much appreciated.

Background: 23m. year and a half ago I developed a dull hunger pain in upper abdomen that would go away when I ate food. Diagnosed with gastritis, Prescribed omeprazole one 40mg/day and problem went away within a few days (medicine taken for ~3 weeks).

This last summer I started taking my health seriously and got in shape, lost 40 pounds over a 4 month period from healthy foods/caloric deficit/lifting and have maintained that weight for a month and a half now.

This thanksgiving break, I ate a lot of not the healthiest food (I mean a lot, I wanted to be nice to myself after getting the weight off and it was thanksgiving w family and friends). Two nights in a row I ate burger and fries for dinner, etcLOTS of fatty foods i think and desserts. Also got into a bad habit of eating pretty close to bedtime.

a few days after I got back to school from break (around 2 weeks ago), I noticed sharp intermittent pains in the right side/middle of my chest, started watching my eating habits out of fear and not eating 3/4 hours before bed.

858,sxzqfx,t5_2s23e,"MS and Behçet's disease? Anyone else has these two suckers?
Sorry for the long rant, but I don't know what else to do. 
I have been going downhill since when I was 24 (now 40yo). I had my first auto-imune disease diagnosed then (Hashimoto's thyroiditis), but I knew something else was up. The constant pain, gut issues and pain, had a different kind of infection nearly every month, mouth ulcers, headaches, dizziness, constant falls and weird accidents around the house and at work place. Stress fractures of L5/S1 at 17 weeks pregnant (no falls this time). And then 5 years ago the debilating fatigue started as well as more pain and swollen joints. 2 years ago, dysphasia and cognitive impairment. I am specialist nurse, so I knew something was up. In March 2020 started to have fevers, once a day, some cough and shortness of breath. Just when COVID started. I was dismissed as being crazy. But had fevers almost daily for 13 months straight. Oral steroids were of no help. 
But, the immunity specialists in my hospital were relentless. A lot of tests, including genetic testing, hospital stays and more testing. 
Conclusion: a possible ankylosis spondylitis was already being considered before 2020 and was better with very strong pain killers, and a definite Behçet's disease that already affects my heart and lungs as well, causing high BP and tachycardia was diagnosed in November 2020. Started treatment with adalimumab Feb 2021. Two months later started to see improvement. The fevers were gone. 
On the 10th June 2021 started to have blurry vision. The following day the blurry vision was accompanied by a pain whenever I moved my eye, and headaches (optic neuritis). Did a brain MRI: MS present. 
Had to stop the Adalimumab. 
The only treatment they could think of, because any of the MS treatments will get the Behçet's worse and vice-versa, was Rituximab. Did the induction dose in September 2021, the following month a second optic neuritis. 
Had COVID in November, with bilateral pneumonia. 
Since then the Behçet's got worse again and I am back to daily fevers and getting worse. The ulcers are now affecting also my vagina. 
Taking Colchicine 1+1/2 and Sulfasalazine 500 mg 2+2. 
Can't eat anything sweet, even some fruits, anything acid, trying to avoid gluten, and it's a no-no to dairy products also. I try to walk more than 8000 steps a day. But can't work anymore. 
The headache (retrobulbar) is getting on my nerves today, but I am seeing my neurologist tomorrow. 
Does anyone out there has both of these two diseases? If so, what treatment(s) are you talking? 
Thank you if you made it this far.

Curious to see if anyone else was ever diagnosed with accentuated POTS. 

Originally it was thought I had hypovolemic POTS with runs of SVT. It was common for me to have a heart rate of 160-180 at rest and spike above 210 for no reason. My HR responded well to Corlanor but my POTS symptoms never really improved.

Then I got the flu. I was severely ill for a week, then I started having severe nausea and vomiting for 3 months after. Suddenly my POTS changed. I had a high HR, but it was suddenly moreso my blood pressure being startlingly variable. They decided to redo my TTT and they found a huge increase in my BP at standing and I was highly symptomatic (flushing, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, eventually fainting). But my heart rate only jumped 40 BPM. My blood pressure went from normal ranges to 180/110 and stayed there before suddenly dropping back to normal.

Up until a couple weeks ago, Ive been forcing myself to eat cooked vegetables and fruit, despite the fact that they trigger my GERD, because I thought it was necessary to gain nutrition.

Since I started the cold showers I havent changed my diet/alcohol at all and havent had a flair up. (If I do get a tingle in my feet, its usually after a weekend of excess, but its cleared after a shower or two.) That was until yesterday, when I got hit with an attack over night that made my foot feel like it was about to split apart.  I realized I had stopped the cold showers for the last few weeks. Probably because of the weather getting much colder and it can be hard to get motivated for a cold shower in the morning. 

That  being said, I did all the normal stuff: extra water, no booze, apple cider vinegar, and ibuprofen. (I also tried nettle tea for the first time which seemed to help) but also took an extra long cold shower and one today. And its like magic. I can walk with very minimal pain and feel like I might have dodged a bullet. 

The best part is that is friggen free! Youre going to be showering anyway just make the last few minutes as cold as it gets! Im not saying that it will work for everyone, but based on my experience Im convinced that its helping me. 

He has a few books out. I listened to his book on tape narrated by Apolo Ohno, the Olympic speed skater. The benefits go way beyond gout; he claims it helps anything from arthritis to cancer. Not that can cure cancer, but MAY help the symptoms and progression. 

I thought Id share the personal insight with other people that I really feel could benefit from it.

892,oxfr8k,t5_2syer,"Why are medical professionals so reluctant to have anything to do with gout?
Is it a liability issue or something? I don't understand, gout isn't exactly a new illness. I'm at 3.5 weeks into an attack and have gotten stonewalled by almost everyone. My experiences so far:


1. After one week of suffering I went through my insurance provider's telehealth service. Doctor told me it couldn't be gout because it wasn't in my big toe (was in my ankle) and it took a day to reach peak intensity, instead of an hour or two. (Joke's on him, now it's in my toe...)

2. 1.5 weeks in, went to urgent care in agony with my ankle looking like a balloon. Doctor told me it could be gout but I need to go see a primary care physician. Took x-rays but refused to order a lab for uric acid (the lab was literally next door) without me seeing my PCP first. Asked him if I should keep taking Advil since I'd been on it 1.5 weeks and he told me it probably wasn't safe but didn't give me any other options. Sent me on my way.

3. 2 weeks in, saw my PCP, told me it's probably gout and referred me to a rheumatologist. Got the first appointment I could in a fifty mile radius, which is for the very end of August. Ask if they can write up the uric acid lab order in advance so we can focus on that in the appointment, but get denied.

4. 2 weeks in, in such agony I went to push health because I was desperate for a prescription for literally anything. To their massive credit, the physician immediately sent over prescriptions for colchicine and prednisone. Gave me 10 days worth of prednisone and I got to be pain free for the first time in weeks.

5. 3ish weeks in, Prednisone runs out and I'm miserable, so reach out to push health again and get prescribed half the dosage I had before to start tapering off. Back to suffering.

6. 3.5 weeks in, go to another urgent care and they send me away because they won't treat gout.


I used up the last of my ability to walk today to try and get to that urgent care, so now I guess I'll try my luck with another telehealth visit. I can't afford a trip to the ER unfortunately, otherwise I would've gone weeks ago. This feels like a game of hot potato and I'm the big stupid potato.

Edit: just got off my second telehealth visit with the same service from #1 above and had a completely different experience. Doctor was super understanding, respected that I had done my research, didn't try to force me off prednisone and instead wrote me a prescription for 2x the dosage I was taking before and for allo. So grateful, but at the same time it's frustrating to know that if I had seen him 2.5 weeks ago I'd be in a much better place.

I have no cognition issues, I have no behaviour problems and have been working from home and also excercising

Hi all! Diagnosed with POTS around 2 months ago. Ive been taking metoprolol for around 4 months and added in midodrine when I was diagnosed.

905,soti3e,t5_2saq9,"Exercising with POTS + Adderall?
I recently found out I have pots. Ive always been a super inactive person and its gotten worse since the pandemic. Ive never exercised consistently in my entire life (24F). Over the pandemic I moved into an apartment with a gym and have only used it a handful of times.

I just started a higher dose of Adderall XR (was on 10mg, went to 20mg) and I feel like this is a good dose for me. Ive been on it for 2 days and decided to go to the gym today. When I started the 10mg, from what I remember, my BPM was higher from it but then after a week or so it went back to normal. I noticed its been a little bit higher since I started the 20mg as well, but nothing crazy. 

Im not sure how high my pulse goes when Ive exercised in the past because I havent started regularly tracking it until recently. Today when I went to the gym I did the treadmill for 15 minutes (wanted to do 30 but got scared because of my pulse). I did an incline of 12, with a speed of 2mph (doesnt seem like anything crazy but Im extremely out of shape and sit the entire day every day).

My pulse ended up staying consistently around 188 BPM. I felt fine for the most part, didnt feel like I was overexerting myself and I was drinking water throughout and ate 2 waffles 30 min beforehand. Afterwards I did have a bit of a headache for 20 min and while I was on the treadmill I got lightheaded once but it went away shortly.

My adderall usually kicks in within an hour so I tried to time it to where I finished before it kicked in. For someone with pots, is it normal/safe to exercise with my BPM that high and with the combo of Adderall? I would like to start doing an incline of 12 on 2MPH speed for 30 minutes 5 days a week but I dont want to start causing myself health problems. 

For reference, Im 24F, 56 height, 126 pounds, and my resting heart rate is between 60-90 BPM (usually 75), and 130-170 (usually 140) when standing.

Has anyone found that going on a bland/low acid diet has made things worse? I used to be able to eat Mexican with red onion and tons of hot sauce or ketchup with no problems.

912,s29ykc,t5_2s1h9,"How do you deal with the apathy and insomnia that comes with medication?
Hey everyone. So as the title suggests, I can't quite seem to shake off this overwhelming feeling of apathy and insomnia. For reference, I take Aptiom 1000mg monotherapy. The apathy has been going for roughly 9 months now since I got diagnosed and I can't seem to find joy in my life anymore. Anything I used to do and currently do to derive any sort of satisfaction, (i.e. Reading books, playing video games, etc.) just don't bring the same happiness anymore and I'm starting to feel that this is what my life is going to be like for the rest of my life.

On top of this, I have had sleeping difficulties within the same time span and have tried everything from magnesium supplements, melatonin, CBT, and meditation to no avail. My sleeping pattern usually goes something like this:

10:00 PM: Get into bed, close my eyes.

1:00 AM: Wake up, use the bathroom go to bed.

4:00 AM: Wake up, go back to bed.

6:00 AM: Wake up for the final time having felt that I didn't sleep at all.

&#x200B;

I miss having good sleep, and actually feelings of tiredness, but alas, life doesn't care. I've been considering a sleep study with my neuro, but I think that it will only show to them what I've written here and won't do much.

914,rwk4b9,t5_2qlaa,"[26 M] Pantoprazole, dizziness, and bouts of panic.
Ill try to describe my situation as briefly as possible, but I know I have to go a little in-depth of my situation especially for the past two months.

I work at a museum, and the months of October and November 2021 have been really hectic. Lots of sleep cycle interruptions (staying up late), frequent fastfood meals during the day, large gap between my last meal and the next (due to busyness and possibly also due to frequent coffee intakeat most two grandes a day, 5-6 days a week), and bouts of anxiety (feelings of worthlessness, occasional verbal sermons from the boss). I have been diagnosed with GAD and GERD sometime last October 2020, and I know for a fact that my sedentary lifestyle during the pandemic affects my anxiety levels also (I work with a hybrid setup: occasional work from home and report to work at the office).

Anyway, back in late November 2021, I started getting uneasy in the stomach and would have bouts of dizziness, and possibly anxiety from the impeding holiday finances. My leg started acting up with small cramps also, and I havent caught up with proper rest since our last exhibit opening. My default mode then was to ignore work even when there were backlogs needed to be worked on. I started taking omeprazole, thinking my GERD could be acting up again.

About a week later, I sought a family medicine doctor to discuss my aching leg and my intake of the PPI. She had me switch to pantoprazole last December 14, so that we may see some hopeful improvements. I brought up my varicose veins on my left leg also, and it seemed to be due for surgery because its gotten more dilated than the last time I checked. She referred me for a Duplex scan (to scan if blood clots are presentthankfully there werent any), do blood tests (check my sugar,  calcium, and ldl levels) and see a vascular surgeon. Long story short, the leg cramps worsened, and post-scan, I was anxious that my varicose being might be worsening by the hour. I fell into deep health anxiety for two weeks since.

Pantoprazole intake for the past two weeks since have been awfully off, to say the least: I would get hungry more quickly to the point of nausea (had to eat every 4 hrs to make it go away), get dizzy spells (often would think its vertigo), and my chest tightened as well: breathing in deep is okay, but I feel like my chest has to work for it more. Muscle spasms also everywhere, at random occasions.

Saw my doctor after Christmas to rule out some results from the blood test. Calcium levels are low, which could be the cause of the muscle twitches and spasms. Blood sugar and LDL level are a little above normal range, so my doctor advised to do a lifestyle change in 3 months and reassess if Im a candidate for prediabetes and lower the bad cholesterol present in my blood. Varicose vein needs to be surgically lasered as per the vascular surgeon I sought, but Im financially challenged to proceed immediately.

I wasand still amleft with so much health anxiety, that it has paralyzed my disposition over the holidays. I fell into trying to self-diagnose (not a good ideabut I was batshit scared and no one to turn to with my thoughts).

I weaned off pantoprazole for a week to test if it was causing me more anxiety, and the uneasiness went away for two days. Leg cramps didnt, and I would still think my varicose is acting up, to which would send me into an anxious state.

My partner advised to go back into pantoprazole, yesterday (Jan 4) after a week of weaning off, just so we could complete at least 4 weeks into the the PPI intake in total. But after two days of retake, my previous symptoms surfaced again.

I know this is too long for yall to have read, but would appreciate your feedback on my status? Im working on switching up my diet (less sugar intake, ease in exercise in my daily routine, and more mindfulness exercises to somehow relieve anxiety) as I write. I saw my doctor yesterday and told her my dizziness went away after a week of no pantoprazole intake, and my anxiety was somewhat easing.

I work at a museum, and the months of October and November 2021 have been really hectic. Lots of sleep cycle interruptions (staying up late), frequent fastfood meals during the day, large gap between my last meal and the next (due to busyness and possibly also due to frequent coffee intakeat most two grandes a day, 5-6 days a week), and bouts of anxiety (feelings of worthlessness, occasional verbal sermons from the boss). I have been diagnosed with GAD and GERD sometime last October 2020, and I know for a fact that my sedentary lifestyle during the pandemic affects my anxiety levels also (I work with a hybrid setup: occasional work from home and report to work at the office).

Anyway, back in late November 2021, I started getting uneasy in the stomach and would have bouts of dizziness, and possibly anxiety from the impeding holiday finances. My leg started acting up with small cramps also, and I havent caught up with proper rest since our last exhibit opening. My default mode then was to ignore work even when there were backlogs needed to be worked on. I started taking omeprazole, thinking my GERD could be acting up again.

About a week later, I sought a family medicine doctor to discuss my aching leg and my intake of the PPI. She had me switch to pantoprazole last December 14, so that we may see some hopeful improvements. I brought up my varicose veins on my left leg also, and it seemed to be due for surgery because its gotten more dilated than the last time I checked. She referred me for a Duplex scan (to scan if blood clots are presentthankfully there werent any), do blood tests (check my sugar,  calcium, and ldl levels) and see a vascular surgeon. Long story short, the leg cramps worsened, and post-scan, I was anxious that my varicose being might be worsening by the hour. I fell into deep health anxiety for two weeks since.

Pantoprazole intake for the past two weeks since have been awfully off, to say the least: I would get hungry more quickly to the point of nausea (had to eat every 4 hrs to make it go away), get dizzy spells (often would think its vertigo), and my chest tightened as well: breathing in deep is okay, but I feel like my chest has to work for it more. Muscle spasms also everywhere, at random occasions.

Saw my doctor after Christmas to rule out some results from the blood test. Calcium levels are low, which could be the cause of the muscle twitches and spasms. Blood sugar and LDL level are a little above normal range, so my doctor advised to do a lifestyle change in 3 months and reassess if Im a candidate for prediabetes and lower the bad cholesterol present in my blood. Varicose vein needs to be surgically lasered as per the vascular surgeon I sought, but Im financially challenged to proceed immediately.

I wasand still amleft with so much health anxiety, that it has paralyzed my disposition over the holidays. I fell into trying to self-diagnose (not a good ideabut I was batshit scared and no one to turn to with my thoughts).

I weaned off pantoprazole for a week to test if it was causing me more anxiety, and the uneasiness went away for two days. Leg cramps didnt, and I would still think my varicose is acting up, to which would send me into an anxious state.

My partner advised to go back into pantoprazole, yesterday (Jan 4) after a week of weaning off, just so we could complete at least 4 weeks into the the PPI intake in total. But after two days of retake, my previous symptoms surfaced again.

I know this is too long for yall to have read, but would appreciate your feedback on my status? Im working on switching up my diet (less sugar intake, ease in exercise in my daily routine, and more mindfulness exercises to somehow relieve anxiety) as I write. I saw my doctor yesterday and told her my dizziness went away after a week of no pantoprazole intake, and my anxiety was somewhat easing.

I first started with IBS 5.5 years ago and it essentially ruined my life. After an insane amount of trial and error, I found a way to reduce my symptoms massively. I went from 10+BMs some days to now 0-2.

Hi Im just looking for advice. My (27F) boyfriend (26M) of 4 years has epilepsy. He had his first seizure early 2019 and medication compliance has been an ongoing issue & has caused a strain in our relationship. It started as nocturnal seizures and they seem to be controlled by Keppra. Earlier this year I gave up on hassling him to take his medication and he decided to stop taking it and went without meds for about 4 months and had a really bad grand mal while awake in august. He has started back taking his medication but isnt Consistent. He had a bad nocturnal seizure last week that caused him to fall out of bed and hit his head/body on surrounding furniture (hes fine btw I moved the furniture out the way in time not to cause any serious injuries). When I try to talk to him about taking his medication as prescribed he shuts down and has called me controlling in the past. Im just looking for some advice about how to approach him on his medication compliance and support him more. I think he may still be denial about having epilepsy and I dont know how to support him through this.

928,roxze3,t5_2s1h9,"I started seizures later in life. Please advise
I had my first seizure 3 years ago. The day after my birthday, at night. I woke up to my husband distraught and 3 EMTs. I was so confused. 

After that I would have 1 seizure a month two more times, at night until I finally saw a neurologist. I was put on lamotrigine. I had 2 more seizures while on the medication and then nothing at night. I was happy.

But then I noticed something else was happening. During the day I would ruminate-- whether an image or thought, and then get this feeling in the pit of my stomach, my mouth kept filling up with saliva and I would just keep swallowing and swallowing. It felt like forever but it was at most a minute. I could finally control myself, would go get water and just give myself a minute or 2 before feeling good enough to get back to what I was doing. I asked my doctor and he mentioned temporal lobe seizures. I put 2 and 2 together and realized prior to my first grand mal, I was having these temporal lobe things for a good 6 months. I thought they were panic attacks because it would happen around a time when I was particularly anxious or become anxious due to the ruminations and the deja vu. 

I'm reading stories of people saying they can get off the meds, and to me that's such an alien concept because, other than my primary care physician who was the kindest and let me know I need to make lifestyle changes, my neurologists just kept saying, ""okay you're feeling good? No need to up the dose"" or ""you had a seizure? Okay let's up the dose"".

I'm on 100mg x2 daily right now. I was at 150 x2 daily last year but my mood was changing, I was getting mouth sores, and I was also being affected by double vision which is by far the most annoying because it affected the mood changes. Oh, I got depressed really bad, about 3 months, and I kept thinking about suicide. I had a psych evaluation done, mostly because I was about to move (thanks Army) and didn't really want to go anywhere, especially when, despite a clear route of getting better, at least the neurologist I had at the time was trying a little more than the previous one. Plus, I really liked my PCP, he was so nice.

I'm scared. I don't like these mood swings. I'm good and then I just dive into the worst version of me. When I'm at work everything is good, but when I get home I just want to sit and vegetate. I haven't gone back to taking a walk/jog with my dogs which really helps my anxiety. I already walk around a lot at work, and apparently I now have plantar fasciitis. 

Maybe I'm not communicating with my neurologist clearly enough? At the new place I'm at I won't be able to be seen by a doctor until early April, and even that isn't a total guarantee... I'm trying to see if I can do telehealth appointments with the neurologist I had before moving. With the holidays I won't get an answer until the new year gets started. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I don't think lamotrigine is for me, but I've also cut back on lifestyle things that help my anxiety and also help me get my weight down because I had PCOS and hidradenitis suppurativa, so I can't deny I haven't been totally on the ball with the meds. I also know the amount I take 2x a day is pretty low in comparison to others, but with these mood changes, depression, and those suicide thoughts I'm scared to go any higher... Then again I went down and still have these things going on.

Hi everyone! Im 39 years old, I was diagnosed in my early 20s. At the time I was not put on medication. I only get one, maybe two flare ups a year.

953,qoji56,t5_2syer,"Another mini flare, and getting back into supplement roulette
I had a bad day with inflammation on Friday. My feet were pretty bad: about the worst they've been in a year, which is still way less than what it was at my very worst. I also had some minor inflammation in my wrists and fingers. My whole body felt that way, but mainly my extremities, so there was definitely something systemic going on. (For reference, I've been on my current allo dose of 450 mg for a year and my uric acid level has consistently been around 3 mg/dL.) Thankfully Saturday was a lot better.

I'm kind of wondering now if Friday's inflammation was a weird delayed reaction to my flu shot from Monday. I wouldn't have thought so except for the fact that my arm was aching a little today. But to be honest I've had some low-level inflammation going on for a few weeks that I can't explain, along with an uptick in canker sores. I've already put together that my worst flares and my mini-flares have always been preceded by a high level of mouth ulcer activity, but I haven't been able to find any information as to why that might be. (As far as I can tell my symptoms do not fit Bechet's. I'm not looking for a diagnosis from anyone here, but definitely curious if anyone has had similar issues or has any insights I can investigate.)

Anyway I've had so many issues on and off with minor inflammation I'm looking to get more serious  about treating it, especially with supplements if I can find any good ones.

I just started diosmin to see if that will help anything. One of the things I've noticed also is that my feet are colder during flares and mini-flares, which suggests my circulation is being impeded. (I am overweight but not diabetic or pre-diabetic.) I recently read something about diosmin and started looking into it and found it's supposedly helpful for inflammation, blood pressure, etc., so I thought it would be worth experimenting a little, with caution.

Additionally I've been reading that folate has a major role to play here. I was using that for a while but stopped when I ran out, and haven't been taking a B complex because I get too much niacin as it is.

I had a bad day with inflammation on Friday. My feet were pretty bad: about the worst they've been in a year, which is still way less than what it was at my very worst. I also had some minor inflammation in my wrists and fingers. My whole body felt that way, but mainly my extremities, so there was definitely something systemic going on. (For reference, I've been on my current allo dose of 450 mg for a year and my uric acid level has consistently been around 3 mg/dL.) Thankfully Saturday was a lot better.

I'm kind of wondering now if Friday's inflammation was a weird delayed reaction to my flu shot from Monday. I wouldn't have thought so except for the fact that my arm was aching a little today. But to be honest I've had some low-level inflammation going on for a few weeks that I can't explain, along with an uptick in canker sores. I've already put together that my worst flares and my mini-flares have always been preceded by a high level of mouth ulcer activity, but I haven't been able to find any information as to why that might be. (As far as I can tell my symptoms do not fit Bechet's. I'm not looking for a diagnosis from anyone here, but definitely curious if anyone has had similar issues or has any insights I can investigate.)

Anyway I've had so many issues on and off with minor inflammation I'm looking to get more serious  about treating it, especially with supplements if I can find any good ones.

I just started diosmin to see if that will help anything. One of the things I've noticed also is that my feet are colder during flares and mini-flares, which suggests my circulation is being impeded.

I recently read something about diosmin and started looking into it and found it's supposedly helpful for inflammation, blood pressure, etc., so I thought it would be worth experimenting a little, with caution.

I don't consider myself to currently have any lung involvement. I don't get chest pains, I'm not generally short of breath, all that good stuff.

Holy smokes what a journey. 

Happy to report, I still have both my toes :) I almost had to shed one you get it.

On a much more serious note: This was the worst gout attack of my life. Im 30, and was first diagnosed with gout when I was 16 (thanks mom). 

The first feeling of gout occurred immediately after my buddies wedding last month where we all enjoyed way too many adult beverages

As we know, it started with that bone-shaking tingling feeling. Which rapidly moved into a full blown attack with what looked like a golf ball lodged in my big toes joint. 

Sure, prednisone and indomethacin helped But it didnt do the job. This was a bad flare up, like very bad. After drinking gallons of water (to the point of water-toxicity), a good amount of cherry juice, veggies, etc. Nothing was helping. 

To the point, I started googling permanent gout. Yikes. 

Then one day, a good friend of mine asked if I had given acupuncture a shot? I had not. Outside of not being a huge fan of needles, I said what the heck and gave it a try 

I kid you not

One of the best decisions of my life. 

In 5 days, just 3 sessions later, that once described golfball in my left big toe, actually looks better than my right big toe (that doesnt have gout). 

I can walk!

See, the acupuncture was able to reduce the tension in my joints and drive my immune system to the point of the pain. After 1-2 weeks, the body registers the attack as non-fatal, so it lets up on the focus to pay attention to other bodily needs. 

Furthermore, the acupuncture can help process fluids that have become stale and hard (bone-like) over time. If youve had gout for years like I, this crap is still there and will just compound..

I come to you today, a changed man. This was a lifestyle moment, and a lifestyle change is only fitting. 

If youre going through a gout attack, stay strong! It will pass. And try acupuncture!!

Hello, thanks for everyone who is reading this. This is my first time using the app, i m sorry in advance for my bad english (i m romanian). 

So 2 years ago i had a seizure (my first and only seizure). And it completely fucked me up but the same time put me on track. The thing is no one knows why i had this seizure. Its a mess my life was a mess composed of heavy alcohol drinking and smoking a pack a day, really bad sleep schedule and everything (also was 16). The day i had the seizure i drank a bit during the day and 8 hours later i took really strong painkillers to help with jaw tooth pain. The problem was that the pain was caused by pus and the painkillers didn't do shit, so my dumbass thought that if i took more it will help. Also it was quarantine time and no dentist worked so that didn't help. Turned out probably that taking that many painkillers combined with my lifestyle at that time didn't go well together and i had a seizure for like 12 minutes ended up in the hospital for 3 days. After i complete more EEGs the doctor said it was an one time thing and that it will probably never happen again and that i m not epyleptic. After that i was free to go. Now i have a healthy lifestyle and i ve been seizure free. But i still cant get those moments out of my head. Everyday i think about it and i m really scared of having a seizure again. It makes me anxious all the time cuz i m scared. I m scared that it can happen anytime, when i m in the bathtub or home alone, or on the street and shit. It makes me feel unsafe. Some days ago it got really bad because i saw my friend have a seizure while we where playing football. Idk if a seizure can cause PTSD. It gets really scary when i have a day where i didn't sleep enough and i feel dizzy and shit. It even makes me anxious and keeps me awake at night when i like flinch while trying to sleep and after that i cant sleep because for a split second it felt like i will have a seizure again. It fucks me up everyday and idk how to cope w it. It was the worst thing that ever happened to me. I want to know if i should go to a therapist. I really feel like i have PTSD because of it.

966,r5kea1,t5_2rtve,"Help with symptoms?Suspecting lupus.
Im gonna keep this short and sweet:
21 years old,generally healthy entire life

No history of prior chronic/autoimmune diseases,allergies or reaction to any medication whatsoever

Generally sedentiary,minus relatively physically demanding job.

Generally a undereater whole life,somewhat skinny 

For the past 7-8 months(perhaps even as long as 2 years) I have been getting frequent low-grade fevers.

So far unable to find out the cause or any apparent pattern;sometimes it happens after physical activity,sometimes i can workout/work with intensity and be fine.

As time passes,the frequency of the fevers appears to increase - severity appears to be the same.

I was taking vitamins called IMMUNOGLUKAN(vitamin C,zink and something called imunoglukan)for multiple months,in addition to 1 month of using vitamin B supplements as well.
During the first month of this i had no fevers,functioned normally and thought that vitamin deficiencies vere the culprit;however the fevers came back after some time  and i was still using the vitamin C and zink supplements;i only used vitamin B supplemntation for one month.

Temperature is usually normal in the morning,then about 16-18h starts to increase

Symptoms of what i refer to as ""fever""(apologise if i used the wrong term):
- I feel weary,get teary eyed,trouble focusing

-Muscle aches(mostly in the calves,sometimes in upper leg,rarely anywhere else,but always in the calves)

-Body temperature NEVER goes above 37C(98.6F)
Sometimes it is very slightly elevated than normal,but i feel something is wrong.If my body temp is higher than 37C,it happens maybe a few times a year,with strong evidence that it is common cold/flu.When it comes to my 'regular' fevers it is NEVER higher than this.

-General fatigue,increased sensitivity to the cold

When i first realised that the frequent occurence of my fevers is abnormal and decided to visit the doctor(about august this year),i did a whole line of blood works:if i understand correctly,we have ruled out the following ailments:
-Any thyroid related condition
-Leukemia
-Most auto immune diseases
-Hormonal problems
-Cancer
I also never tested positive to Covid-19,in spite of the fact that my entire household has had it twice,been tested positive,and even though i had some general symptoms also found in the common colds,at the same time as them,i never once tested positive.
My bloodwork results,urine tests,throat swabs always come,without fail,completely normal with no sign of anything that indicates any underlying condition.
I don't know if this is related in any way,but for a long time i always have trouble getting up in the morning, regardless of how much i have slept.I usually get good wuality 8hrs sleep,but rarely ever wake up feeling 'energised'.
I am getting really frustrated to the point i HOPE that 1 test comes back with some answers.At this point i would feel relieved even if it was a serious ilness,as long as i KNEW what it was.This 'condition' is seriously impacting my life.I am lucky that  even if my work is demanding,i maybe work only 10-12 days a month,and make enough money that i can spend the rest of the month lying in my bed if i have to,but even if i dont go to work for an entire month,symptoms are the same so i believe that physical overexertion is not in the equation.

969,sbl0ju,t5_2saq9,"Increasing salt makes me pee more and therefore makes me feel worse - any ideas?
I am 32, have been ill since September 2020 (though I have improved a lot since then), diagnosed with POTS in June/July 2021.

Before being ill, I didn't have much salt in my diet. When I was told I might have POTS and to increase salt, I increased it to approx 5g salt/2g sodium per day, with about 2.5-3 litres of water. Then, when I was actually diagnosed, I wasn't given any advice on how much more salt to consume (and I was aware that some people should not have too much depending on the type of POTS they have).

In December 2021, I was finally told that I am ok to have up to 10g salt/4g sodium per day (I do not have hyperadrenergic POTS). So I started increasing it to about 7g salt/2.8g sodium, with 3 litres of water per day.

Here's my problem. Despite spreading the 7g salt intake out throughout the day and through various sources (electrolyte drink, on food, salty snacks), when I eat around 7g salt a day I feel considerably worse, and this seems to be because when I increase my salt intake, I pee more, and therefore become more dehydrated, causing problems like worse orthostatic intolerance and nausea, and low resting blood pressure.

I'm confused about what is going wrong; does anyone else have this problem?

I have a 24 hour urine analysis coming up but that's in a few months, so I'm keen to hear of anyone who has experienced similar issues as I can't find any information about this. Obviously I would check with my doctor before implementing any changes.

972,sv3zoc,t5_2saq9,"tachycardia post food / drink
tw - ed mention 

hey all! questions about tachycardia after food / liquids! 

so i have developed paralysis ileus (which as far as i understand, is like gastroparesis but in the small intestine?) and may also be developing gastroparesis. i have a myriad of digestive issues in general (ulcerative colitis is my major diagnoses, along with EDS + MCAS + POTS, and my EDS and POTS in general seem to be rapidly getting worse. 

rn i am really struggling with bad tachycardia after i eat or even drink. my EDS specialist has asked me to lay down flat after eating for half an hour but it doesn't seem to help. my heart rate laying down like this can be up to 160bpm, and i get chest pains / tightness and feel short of breath and jittery. 

i think the GI paralysis / motility issues might be contributing to the tachycardia? not 100% sure but maybe because i get more full quicker and longer, it is causing my blood to rush to my digestive system since everything is just slower moving at the moment? 

i avoid caffeine because i just don't like it, but i've noticed a particular trigger for my tachycardia is the hot chocolate i have as my comfort drink. i am struggling with an eating disorder and sometimes the only thing i can get myself to have is my hot chocolate, which i make with Milo (sort of like ovaltine, it's has malt in it) with hot water and a splash of milk and sometimes fancy things like extra chocolate or spices and whatnot. i've noticed whenever i drink it, even just half a mug, my heart feels like it's going to explode. i know chocolate has some caffeine in it and theobromine, but considering the drink is mostly malt and not a lot of pure cacao, i find it hard to believe that the chocolate is enough to cause my symptoms. 

do you think it could be the heat? does warmer foods or liquids tend to cause more tachycardia? 

any advice in general regarding managing post-food and liquid tachycardia would be great (besides ya know, eat less / smaller portions because i know, and i am but still having issues). should i try and avoid certain temperatures or any other do's or donts ?",claim_per_exp,"i avoid caffeine because i just don't like it, but i've noticed a particular trigger for my tachycardia is the hot chocolate i have as my comfort drink",1031,1182,151,"(S (S (NP (PRP i)) (VP (VBP avoid) (NP (NN caffeine)) (SBAR (IN because) (S (NP (PRP i)) (ADVP (RB just)) (VP (VBP do) (RB n't) (VP (VB like) (NP (PRP it)))))))) (, ,) (CC but) (S (NP (PRP i)) (VP (VBP 've) (VP (VBN noticed) (SBAR (S (NP (NP (DT a) (JJ particular) (NN trigger)) (PP (IN for) (NP (PRP$ my) (NN tachycardia)))) (VP (VBZ is) (NP (NP (DT the) (JJ hot) (NN chocolate)) (SBAR (S (NP (PRP i)) (VP (VBP have) (PP (IN as) (NP (PRP$ my) (NN comfort) (NN drink))))))))))))))",S,1

Just curious what folks experience are with these, particularly when in the midst of an acute attack.

I've mostly used Ibuprofen (somewhat good, not great, at pain but not for swelling/inflammation), and Naproxem (the other way around, seems to temper inflammation but not much for pain). I've used Colchicine a handful of times in the past and wasn't really any better than those two (somewhere in the middle) but gives awful diarrhea. I'm into day-5 of an accute attack (which became significant on day-2) and yesterday began an Indomethacin script from my Doc. Had a 25mg dose at 8pm last night, followed by another around 1am before trying to sleep. Wondering if it has a ramp up time for folks because thus far those two slightly front-loaded doses don't seem any more effective on the pain/swelling so I'm considering going back to Naproxem today. I've always been incredibly leery of combining NSAIDs.

(Have mentioned before, but I'm a 15+ year sufferer who began Allo last August, 100mg then 300mg and now 600mg as of 2 days ago. UA levels have yet to dip below mid 6's. They began around 9.)

I won't reiterate the many details of my story again like I here before. Mostly just interested in folks Indo experience - lots of Cochicine and prednisone stories but not as much Indo that I can find.

I went to an MFM and she said I could take it or leave it with the hydroxychloroquine because I had never taken it before pregnancy (what if I had an unusual reaction?) and I wasnt in pain. I didnt take it. 

At 8 weeks, I wasnt feeling so hot anymore. My joint pain started to become more prominent again, but not debilitating. I started taking the hydroxychloroquine at this time. 

At week 10-12 I was feeling slightly better. I thought this was from the meds. 

At 14 weeks now I would say my joint pain is at 70-80% of the worst its ever been. Its difficult for me to climb stairs, get out of chairs, and the pain is bad enough to wake me up at night if I involuntarily move a limb.  I can feel it in many joint when Im at rest. 

Is there anything I can do besides continue to take hydroxychloroquine? Im taking baby aspirin but as Im sure youre aware, it doesnt do shit. I take epsom salt baths daily.

So my doctor prescribed me pepcid and informed me of trigger foods.

I've found that even with the medication, I feel consistent nausea, so I'm going to try cutting out coffee, and if it doesn't improve, then I will eliminate the next most likely culprit. However, I am having trouble coming to terms with having to change my diet because I LOVE coffee, spicy food, pasta with tomatoes/tomato sauce, and dairy (cheese/yogurt).

988,spyqsp,t5_2s3g1,"1st Colonoscopy Next Week-A Bit Nervous on My Symptoms
Hi all-

Late thirties, male.  A bit of a control freak about my health which is probably why I am down the rabbit hole and worried about this scope next week.

I have always had on/off constipation but typically without any real pain.  Naturally, some discomfort but nothing I would consider pain.  Typically, I would barely go during the week then have a couple normal BMs on the weekend.  I travel a lot and usually eat high protein/a bit short on fiber diet so I do not think much of this.  A couple months ago though, I started having smaller stools and not having my weekend BM's.  When I do have them, they can look sometimes odd shaped with indentions, sometimes square edges and typically no bigger than walnuts although sometimes I get half-way normal looking ones that are about 3 inches in length.  TMI I am sure.  For my diet, I eat spinach and blueberries literally everyday in a shake so the color of everything is usually darker shade of brown but certainly not black. 

Anyways, last couple of weeks I have really upped the fiber to the 38gm/day typically and I have been having BMs daily but, they are still in pieces.  No straining 99% of them time and they just come out clean but, in pieces.  In regards to blood, only once have I seen pink blood on the TP after the day prior I did have to strain and had what I would call a peanut BM.  Have not seen anything else.  Please keep in mind I exercise daily, eat 160-190gm protein/day and around 130gm carbs/day along with 50gm/fat.  Last 2 weeks i have used metamucil and chia seeds to see if it helps.

Went to the GI and expected them to listen to my diet and tell me to try miralax or something else but instead, they talked to me for 5 minutes and decided I should get a colonoscopy.  Based on lots of the info I have read here, that seems strange since some of you guys seem to have to demand one.  So naturally, it makes me nervous to think the docs expect something more sinister but they insisted it was more to rule things out.

So, end of next week I get my first colonoscopy.  From what I have read, IBS usually presents with pain which I have none of.  This makes me a bit anxious.  **Have any of you experienced similar symptoms minus ""pain"" and it been nothing?**  I Have no family history of the big C but, my mom/grandmother/aunt does struggle with bowel issues and mainly constipation so I am hoping I just get it honest.  One of the things that is keeping me somewhat positive is that I had CT scans about 16 months ago for something unrelated and there was nothing in my pelvic/abdomen.  Of course, things can change but at least back then they saw zero.

992,qnt7il,t5_2syer,"First time posting, 2 weeks in. Heres my story
Two weeks ago, started my first ever gout attack. Recap to the weekend before. Oct 9th. Big night out, had a shit ton to drink and ate a shit ton of junk ( greasy hotdogs and hamburgers). Basically fun night out without the kids.

Fast forward to Tuesday, Oct. 12th. Started having slight pain in my right hip. Didnt care too much about, went on with my day with a limp. Little did I know, those were the signs of my first ever gout flare up.

Wednesday oct 13th. A little more painful than the day before. Also left hip is acting up slightly. By the end of the day was a lot better in the right but left was sore. 

Thursday Oct 14th all hell breaks loose. 
I had scheduled a massage on Tuesday with my massage therapist, and no way in hell was I going to miss out, but I was in pain. Left hip was killing me. The pain in my right Foot was agonizing though. 

Managed to limp my way to the car, go brief my staff at my shop, and managed to drive my way to my massage therapists location even though just having shoes on my feet was agonizing let alone reaching the gas pedal and brake pedals was dangerous. Thank god my car is recent and has adaptive cruise control with brake sensing tech that helps stops on cruise control. ( I also made sure to know my limits in movement before leaving and managed to keep enough distance to compensate the lack of speed and force from my foot.)

Anyways, I get my massage and my hips get a little better (practically no pain afterwards) but as she gets to my right foot, I screamed. She tried again for a few minutes and told her to finish with my lower back instead of continuing with my feet. At that point she also told me my foot felt like jello to the touch and she hadnt really put much pressure. So she finishes and tells me yeah I would get some rest and put ice on it if I were you. 

So I do the opposite. Go back to my shop and try to work. My foot just keeps hurting more and more, and cafter spending two hours at my desk so is my hip. I called my mom asked her to bring me my cane from an operation I had 15 years ago. She eventually comes to bring it to me. Then, the moment I realized it was time to consult is when I tried to get out of my chair. I just couldnt. The pain was so bad I wasnt able to get up. 

At that point I had members of my staff roll me out the front door from my office chair and closest they could to my car and my wife drove me off to the ER.

After 7 excruciating hours of waiting in an uncomfortable wheel chair, I finally get my first diagnosis of gout. Doctors say my hip wasnt gout, but to this day I beg to differ.

So basically they get me started on colchicine asap and tell me to watch what I eat because my UA levels are very high(still to this day do not know how high). 1 pill once at home second 2 hours later.

During the night had to pee in a cup because the pain was so excruciating i did not dare get up. Next morning my attack is still bad, both my hips were in pain but my foot was a bit better. Had to struggle to get to the bathroom with crutches.

Come Saturday the 16th Im doing a bit better. So I do what I normally do, just a bit slower than usual cause Im limping with a cane. I was happy. Signs were good and telling me to put this story behind me. I call my parents and we meet up for breakfast at the restaurant. Victory was mine better in two days. So I ordered pancakes and bacon. A treat! Homemade hamburger at lunch and porc chops for supper. A nice can of Pepsi and some Doritos with a movie. Saturday night I was without a cane and without a care. Life was good again. Fuck the diet and live on like a king !!

Boy, I realized how much a dumb ass I was come Sunday morning. Full attack mode again. Enough pain for me to have to piss in a cup again. This attack spans out to Tuesday. Wednesday back to work but still in pain. At least it was mild and in one hip by then. Ended up working four hours and left because my hands were numb and slightly painful. I rest up during the afternoon. Wake up around 4 when my son gets home from school. My hands were stiff, but made supper for him and my wife who was picking up some of my hours at the shop. Put the kids to bed and started playing a game on my phone, until I couldnt hold my phone anymore. 

Thursday morning, after a shitty night of kids waking up 3 times and the pain in my hands, I decide to call my doctor. Another day out of my shop.

I only get a call back on Friday the 18th. She prescribed Prednisone and sent me for blood work and X-rays. Shes concerned it may be rheumatoid arthritis.

Saturday I get my script and take the first dose first thing in the am. My pain on Saturday was mostly in my left hip. The prednisone worked like a charm. By 2pm I was up and walking and helping my wife and her father without winter tire swap.

From then, life was great. No more pain. Hell, I made it through halloween with two kids running around every street in our hood.

Come Nov 1st though, the prednisone was gone. Unfortunately by noon, the pain was back. Slight pain in the hip and my knee was bugging me. Tuesday all clear, until 3 pm. My left knee was bugging me a lot. So was my right hand.

I left work to go rest. I was expecting a call from the doc on Wednesday anyway, so no panic. Wednesday was shit. My left knee was swollen and really sensitive. Finally 11 am comes, talked to doc, not RA but confirmed gout. UA very high prescribed Colchicine allopurinol and Voltaren. 

Started This Wednesday. Knee got better Thursday, spent with practically no pain. Today, well my hands hurt like hell.Especially my ring finger on the left and my major on the right.

Whats next. This fucking sucks. My anxiety is out of control. I dont know what to expect tomorrow, how much pain, where? This sucks.

Sorry for the long post, I kinda needed to vent a little, but I would like to know if you guys have had any similar experiences and how long did they last? I kind of hope itll get better soon.

At that point she also told me my foot felt like jello to the touch and she hadnt really put much pressure. So she finishes and tells me yeah I would get some rest and put ice on it if I were you. 

So I do the opposite. Go back to my shop and try to work. My foot just keeps hurting more and more, and cafter spending two hours at my desk so is my hip. I called my mom asked her to bring me my cane from an operation I had 15 years ago. She eventually comes to bring it to me. Then, the moment I realized it was time to consult is when I tried to get out of my chair. I just couldnt. The pain was so bad I wasnt able to get up. 

At that point I had members of my staff roll me out the front door from my office chair and closest they could to my car and my wife drove me off to the ER.

After 7 excruciating hours of waiting in an uncomfortable wheel chair, I finally get my first diagnosis of gout. Doctors say my hip wasnt gout, but to this day I beg to differ.

So basically they get me started on colchicine asap and tell me to watch what I eat because my UA levels are very high(still to this day do not know how high). 1 pill once at home second 2 hours later.

During the night had to pee in a cup because the pain was so excruciating i did not dare get up. Next morning my attack is still bad, both my hips were in pain but my foot was a bit better. Had to struggle to get to the bathroom with crutches.

Come Saturday the 16th Im doing a bit better. So I do what I normally do, just a bit slower than usual cause Im limping with a cane. I was happy. Signs were good and telling me to put this story behind me. I call my parents and we meet up for breakfast at the restaurant. Victory was mine better in two days. So I ordered pancakes and bacon. A treat! Homemade hamburger at lunch and porc chops for supper. A nice can of Pepsi and some Doritos with a movie. Saturday night I was without a cane and without a care. Life was good again. Fuck the diet and live on like a king !!

Boy, I realized how much a dumb ass I was come Sunday morning. Full attack mode again. Enough pain for me to have to piss in a cup again. This attack spans out to Tuesday. Wednesday back to work but still in pain. At least it was mild and in one hip by then. Ended up working four hours and left because my hands were numb and slightly painful. I rest up during the afternoon. Wake up around 4 when my son gets home from school. My hands were stiff, but made supper for him and my wife who was picking up some of my hours at the shop. Put the kids to bed and started playing a game on my phone, until I couldnt hold my phone anymore. 

Thursday morning, after a shitty night of kids waking up 3 times and the pain in my hands, I decide to call my doctor. Another day out of my shop.

I only get a call back on Friday the 18th. She prescribed Prednisone and sent me for blood work and X-rays. Shes concerned it may be rheumatoid arthritis.

Saturday I get my script and take the first dose first thing in the am. My pain on Saturday was mostly in my left hip. The prednisone worked like a charm. By 2pm I was up and walking and helping my wife and her father without winter tire swap.

From then, life was great. No more pain. Hell, I made it through halloween with two kids running around every street in our hood.

Come Nov 1st though, the prednisone was gone. Unfortunately by noon, the pain was back. Slight pain in the hip and my knee was bugging me. Tuesday all clear, until 3 pm. My left knee was bugging me a lot. So was my right hand.

I left work to go rest. I was expecting a call from the doc on Wednesday anyway, so no panic. Wednesday was shit. My left knee was swollen and really sensitive. Finally 11 am comes, talked to doc, not RA but confirmed gout. UA very high prescribed Colchicine allopurinol and Voltaren. 

Started This Wednesday. Knee got better Thursday, spent with practically no pain. Today, well my hands hurt like hell.Especially my ring finger on the left and my major on the right.

Whats next. This fucking sucks. My anxiety is out of control. I dont know what to expect tomorrow, how much pain, where? This sucks.

Sorry for the long post, I kinda needed to vent a little, but I would like to know if you guys have had any similar experiences and how long did they last? I kind of hope itll get better soon.

Hey all i am 25years old and recently diagnosed with gout about 4months ago. I'll give a little back story before i get to the part i need advice with, just for completeness. TLDR is at the end and sorry if formating is bad on mobile 

So my first gout attack was about 4years ago after a long night at a bar with some friends. We all got very drunk and went home our separate ways. I woke up the next morning thinking i broke my foot the night before by kicking a curb or something. It was one of the worst pains i have ever felt. This lasted about 2 days and then didn't happen again for another 2years.

The next time it happened i believe it was just a random flair up as it wasn't super painful, just moderately uncomfortable. Fast forward a bit to about 1.5 years ago i moved in with an old college friend and started to gain weight. I think at my highest i was about 248lbs and I'm 5ft 11in so i was fairly overweight. But nothing ever happened with my gout.

Now the advice part. I have decided to move to Germany and thus wanted to go back to my more normal weight of about 205lbs and so i started getting back into my normal gym routine and started playing tennis competitively again. Thus i started to lose a good amount of weight, down to about 218lbs in 5mo however my feet/gout had started acting up like CRAZY. As soon as I began getting very active again I began having attacks at least once a week maybe several times a week. Where I would wake up and couldn't walk, then the next day be fine, and then the day after couldn't walk again. So i finally went to the podiatrist and had the tests done and my uric acid levels have come back at an 8.5 which isn't SUPER high. I started trying seit changes and things but didn't see results fast enough for my active lifestyle as i work out/ go to the gym 5-6 days a week. So i immediately asked to be put on medication and asked for a cortisone shot. This was about 1 month ago. 

Now a month in on Allopurinol 200mg daily I can begin to feel the effects of my cortisone shot wearing off as i am starting to get my weekly attacks again, thus a bit more minor than they use to be. I would also like to mention i had 76mg of  indomethacin and it did absolutely nothing to help. Although I am still very active so it is limiting. I have come to the conclusion that my activity is the actual problem and that i am just not able to stay hydrated enough even though I drink about a gallon of water a day, especially on workout days. I am kinda bummed that the meds haven't began to work yet either. So does anyone have any advice on how to get this better? Stay hydrated? Etc??? I would love some help thanks all.

As a side not it seems to migrate around my foot sometimes. As I'm typing this the pain is actually coming from my ankle joint rather than my toes, but two days ago it was in my big toe just odd...

1020,sv5nh4,t5_2s3g1,"Had an all clear Colonoscopy today! What should I do next?
While awaiting my scope, I read a ton of these posts (I'm excited for a response from goldstandardalmond). 34yo male, never had any IBS issues until this past Thanksgiving. I do feel it was stress related because during that time I had job related issues, new baby on the way, family issues, etc. During that stressful time I vaped weed almost daily. I traveled for Thanksgiving to two different places. Normally takes me a while to get adjusted to a different place to have a movement. I didn't have a significant movement for 1.5 weeks during that travel. That never happens to me, always regular (2-3 times per day). I also didn't have weed or my daily smoothie, during the travel.

When I got home, I decided to use Benefiber for the first time, thinking it would help. I added the total daily amount and didn't start slowly (big mistake). That's when the following symptoms started:

* Incomplete evacuation
* Bloating/Trapped gas
* Green Stool (IBS-M type)
* Undigested food in stool

Then I went to Dr. Google, thought I had the big C and was going to die. These symptoms persisted for a month:

* High Anxiety
* Headaches
* Frequent urination
* small stool caliber
* light abdomen pain that alternated all over
* can feel bowel and rectum spasm inside
* some mucus 

I then focused on relaxing more, prolonged fasted, alternated Slippery Elm, Psyllium Husk, Chia Seeds and Magnesium Citrate to my smoothie. Had great success with Psyllium husk (really bulked up stool and helped improve evacuation) but then it stopped working after a week. All symptoms disappeared during prolonged water-only fasting (48hrs). After fasting and up to today the following systems occur:

* bowel spams/dull pain that alternates around abdomen
* hard flat short stools like one or twice a day. IF the fiber actually works then the stool is bulky and normal. Also looks like you can see bowel constriction marks on it.
* incomplete evacuation
* undigested food from time to time
* Nausea at random times with metallic/bitter taste

The good scope result is a huge relief but its now time to investigate further. Felt like my gastro didn't give a crap about the stress aspect or many of the symptoms. He thought it was some sort of bacteria infection. My thoughts are to see a functional medicine doctor and therapist.  Any other thoughts or things try, tests to request?

Hi,

I think I might have GERD. In feb 2020 I started experiencing acidity, esophagal irritation, trouble swallowing, trouble speaking, tired jaw and neck muscles and tiredness. I put it down to pandemic stress.

My symptoms became a bit better over time, but I started experiencing other symptoms in June 2021, basically a nagging pain under the rib cage, mostly after food, palpitations and ectopic heart beats (heart skipping beats). I greatly reduced my intake of acid and spicy foods which seemed to help a little with the pain and the skipped beats, but I still burp a lot, get skipped beats every now and again and I experience a great amount of brain fog, as if I'm not able to concentrate fully, especially for longer periods.

When I take acid blockers my brain fog immediately clears up for a while, I feel more energy and my heart seems more calm, but whenever I use acid blockers for more than a few days I can't seem to digest any food any more.

I also tried digestive enzyms with betaine HCL which gave me a lot of energy and mental clarity but irritated my esophagus to the point that I developed a severe cough and lost my voice for 4 days.

I'm a bit desperate, and can't seem to find anything that improves the situation for good.

My uncle is a rheumatologist. Few weeks ago i was telling him how i feel sick once or twice every month for no reason.

He told me not to worry about the test and just to make some lifestyle changes like dont take stress, eat my food on time, avoid spicy food( i love spicy food which has been a problem for my digestive system in the past). He also told us to not go to any other doctor about it as most doctors would hype up the issue and make us panic for no reason( which is true for the country i live in, doctors hype up medical issues to get more money and it has happened to me in the past as well).

This is my first time posting here. Im wondering if anyone has experienced what Ive been going through. 

Ever since March 2021, I have had very intense nausea in the back of my throat no matter what I eat. It came out of nowhere and I had never even taken a tum before this. Ive been on so many different medications (Sucralfate, Reglan, Pantoprazole, Esomeprazole, Zofran, etc) and have seen two different GI doctors. Its so bad I spent the first 2 months when I was just on a PPI only eating crackers and still getting nauseous. I ended up losing almost 30 Lbs.

My doctors have done a scope, 2 celiac tests, a HIDA scan, abdominal xrays/ultrasounds, and full blood panels multiple times, but those havent shown anything except hypothyroidism. Ive eaten completely bland the whole time, and I havent attempted drinking. Despite this my doctors tell me every appointment to cut things out that Im already not eating. The past 2 months Ive also experienced insane hair loss, going grey, full body acne, and rashes on the back of my hands. Ive never had a single problem with my health before this, wouldnt even catch a cold or stomach bug.

1040,p1xgpm,t5_2syer,"Saw a rheumatologist for first time today
I posted a few weeks back about my 2nd (suspected) gout attack.  On July 13, I went to my PCP and my Urate level/blood test was 7.2 and PCP said that was normal.  At the time of my appointment, the pain had subsided a bit and my toe was not red/swollen/warm so PCP was not convinced it was gout.  The flareup came back that night with a vengeance (it is always worse at night) and I demanded a referral to a rheumatologist.  After reading all about gout here and on other online resources, I see others saying that 7.2 is not normal and is actually high.

I went to a rheumatologist today and she agreed that what I described was almost definitely gout but some of what she said surprised me/contradicted some of what I've read here and just wanted to get everyone's thoughts.

1- she said that gout is not diagnosed by Urate blood test and instead is diagnosed by either taking fluid from the joint during flare up or by looking at Xrays.  My flare up is over so she ordered Xrays.

2- I thought for sure she would prescribe Allo but she gave me a choice - start Allo right away or wait until Xray results come back and then she will have a better idea if its needed and also a better idea of dosage.   She prescribed Colchicine in case I get another flare-up before I go back to see her in 6 weeks after Xrays.  I chose to wait, get Xrays and see what they reveal.

3- I asked if Allo can cause flares when you first start taking it and she said that is a myth/not true.

Regardless, I am glad I went and that I am on the right track and she did emphasize many times that gout is very manageable/treatable.

Just wanted to share my experience (male 32/dx 2022,
1st half dose today went like this:
drove myself to and back from the hospital (20 mins each way).
1) Took 2 pills of paracetamol , 50 mg benadryl + 125 steroid (both by IV). Just felt a bit sleepy (sort of like the feeling after having 3 glasses of good red wine ;)?) at 1 PM.

2) Ocrevus Infusion started 30 minutes later at 40 mL/hr, took 6 hours to complete the 250 mL too slow but nurses refused to increase the dosing since this is my first. Didnt feel anything at all except slightly faster heart rate. Just had to pee 1000 times.

3) Discharged at 8ish PM. So far just feel slightly tired (same feeling Id normally get if I didnt sleep at night, slight muscle ache but mind is very alert). About to go to sleep. 

Things I learned from this subreddit that might have helped me:
1) Had a massive meal before heading to the hospital, helped with the steroids hunger.

2) HYDRATION by drinking lots of water. I started well before the pre meds and was sipping water throughout the infusion. I think I had 2 liters in total before and during infusion. 

3) Entertainment. Brought my laptop & iPad. Did some work and binge watched the queens gambit. I also had a friend join me which helped a lot pass the time. 

About to go to bed now (10:30 pm). Will see how my sleep goes and update this tomorrow by the end of the day.

So, first night sleep was meh, not sure if it is because of the steroids or just my mind running too fast with thoughts. Day 2 has minor muscle ache (legs mostly) that was gone by the evening time.

Just wanted to share my experience (male 32/dx 2022,
1st half dose today went like this:
drove myself to and back from the hospital (20 mins each way).
1) Took 2 pills of paracetamol , 50 mg benadryl + 125 steroid (both by IV). Just felt a bit sleepy (sort of like the feeling after having 3 glasses of good red wine ;)?) at 1 PM.

2) Ocrevus Infusion started 30 minutes later at 40 mL/hr, took 6 hours to complete the 250 mL too slow but nurses refused to increase the dosing since this is my first. Didnt feel anything at all except slightly faster heart rate. Just had to pee 1000 times.

3) Discharged at 8ish PM. So far just feel slightly tired (same feeling Id normally get if I didnt sleep at night, slight muscle ache but mind is very alert). About to go to sleep. 

Things I learned from this subreddit that might have helped me:
1) Had a massive meal before heading to the hospital, helped with the steroids hunger.

2) HYDRATION by drinking lots of water. I started well before the pre meds and was sipping water throughout the infusion. I think I had 2 liters in total before and during infusion. 

3) Entertainment. Brought my laptop & iPad. Did some work and binge watched the queens gambit. I also had a friend join me which helped a lot pass the time. 

About to go to bed now (10:30 pm). Will see how my sleep goes and update this tomorrow by the end of the day.

UPDATE: Day 2 and Day 3 following infusion 
So, first night sleep was meh, not sure if it is because of the steroids or just my mind running too fast with thoughts. Day 2 has minor muscle ache (legs mostly) that was gone by the evening time. Nothing major really and had the same feeling when I normally dont sleep well or workout a bit more at the gym. 

Went to bed a bit early to get extra sleep and Day 3 so far is perfect. Nothing unusual at all. I hope this is the case for dose 2 and subsequent dosing but we will see :)",claim_per_exp,"

Ive had the hardest time with it and have had most days where Im down including just last week (I did have omicron though so maybe thats why).

Yes I could have been doing this all along but I was more focused on the savior pills like beta blockers and Clonazepam. PLEASE GET A BLOOD TEST FOR VITAMIN LEVELS!!! I started to take two D vitamins and my prescribed B vitamin (Im superrrrrr deficient in B) consistently along with a couple others and all of a sudden after a couple weeks of consistency my heart rate is NORMAL without beta blockers or Clonazepam even if I stand.

I (16F) need some advice on what I should do now. I was diagnosed with POTS last year and after lots of trial and error I was put on Ivabradine and a beta blocker. This did help enough for me not to be bedridden and feel relatively better for a while but now it seems like the beta blocker is making me feel worse. My doctor told me to stop taking Ivabradine but that was the only thing keeping me relatively functional and when suddenly stopped I had a horrible episode that almost left me in the ED. 

So I went for a second opinion and this doctor said that I shouldnt have been taken off of the Ivabradine, much less suddenly, and to start taking it again. This helped. He recommended lots of different tests to rule out other possible diagnosis but everything came back normal. 

However, Im still struggling a lot and Im so weak and fatigued I cant get out of bed most days. Now (I suspect because of the beta blocker) Im not only having tachycardia but lots of bradycardia and dangerously low blood pressure levels. So I reached out again to the second doctor after my most recent episode and all he said is that since all the alternative tests seemed normal its just anxiety and when I tried to explain that anxiety is not the answer he said to calm down because I was probably just hysterical.

Im exhausted of being dismissed. First they both said it most be just a hormonal imbalance because Im a teenager, even when I already had multiple test results that said otherwise. Then, anxiety. (Which doesnt make sense because I had my worst flare up when I was the most relaxed and I felt my best when I had the highest anxiety levels) And now hysteria. (Which btw wtf is this, 1922?). 

I do have a pots diagnosis but everyone dismisses it saying itll eventually go away and that its normal in teenage girls. And since I have developed amazing levels of resistance and I seem put together, they label it a mild case and dont take me seriously no matter how much prove I provide. 

Spending my teenage years without being able to get out of bed or shower without fainting is not normal but none of the specialists take it seriously enough to help me.

now I spent the last week having this blocked throat feeling lasting for hours now like 6-8h and maybe 4h break where I can breathe normal. doesnt really appear to be any triggers except I usually feel ok for a while after waking.

1085,rucwab,t5_2qlaa,"Can GERD come and go? I've had this for 6 months last year (or so I think) and then it dissappeared for months without changing diet, and now it's back again 24/7
I'm quite new here and I thought for about 1.5 years that my symptoms were costochondritis. I was told all sorts of bullshit by doctors. I didnt feel the acid reflux and my main symptom was tightness in the ribcage, sternum pressure and pain near my diaphragm. A feeling of shortness of breath as well. And a very heavy feeling on the right side of my body, near the stomach. 

Seen many specialsts. Pulmonary specialst, intestinal specialst, internal specialst, And they all said it was prob my severe endometriosis I was just diagnosed with. They didn't do much research. Only bloodwork. And a chest x ray. They told me that I would feel better after my endometriosis surgery Nov 30th 2021. My bowel and uterus were attached and I had endometrioma cysts in my ovaries. But no symptom relief afterwards at all. So they were wrong unfortunately. My gynaecologist didn't see any endometriosis spots on the outside of my stomach or diaphragm.

 In fact. After the general anesthesia it has gotten worse and my stomach feels like it's burning and it's so heavy. No matter what I eat or if I eat.. It burns. I've been throwing up 3 days straight after surgery. But after that I felt great for a few days. And then these symptoms arose again. 

 I also suffer upperback and shoulder pain and there is no cause for it. I've had a bonescan, and mri of my lower back. I also suffer neckpain. 
Had a gallbladder ultrasound and blood was checked for gallbladder issues. All came back normal.

I've lived in ibuprofen for years due to my chronic endometriosis and sciatica. Doctors always said it's fine. But I always asked them if it's not too bad for my stomach. I stopped taking it 2 weeks ago. I just wanted to see what it would do. And since then my stomach. symptoms have worsened. 

So last year I started having severe shortness of breath chest pain, and heavy feeling in stomach and lung.
I was doing some arts and crafts at the table. Sitting bending over for a few hours. That's when the stomach issues started. 

 Went to er for it a few times. But they couldn't find anything. I wouldn't say I had reflux. But after dinner I would swell up and bloat so bad and like a brick was sitting on my stomach.

After endometriosis surgery I started having a globus feeling in my throat. Which my gp said is prob anxiety. But I've never had this. The thing is.. That I do have a burning feeling in my stomach again, I feel nauseated, bloated and just overall uncomfortable in my own skin.
I had dinner last night and ate broccoli with some chicken and rice. Which is always nice and I don't bloat. But since I was already feeling bloated and burning stomach I tried a zantac. It's the 3 in 1 chewing Tablet. And it relieved my symptoms after 1 hour. I couldn't believe it.

So I'm figuring out if these chest pains and shortness of breath, abdominal heavy feeling and upperback pains can come from GERD? The globus feeling has send me to an ENT. Who I'm seeing within a couple of weeks. I've been doing arts and crafts again, bended forward again for a few hours and it's making it hell of a lot worse.

I wonder.. Can gerd come and go??? . Last year I've had symptoms for about 6 months. Then they subsided. And now it's there 24/7 again.

You would say take another zantac.. But these tablets are giving me terrible headaches somehow. 

Can this all come from silent reflux/GERD? What should I ask the ENT? Would a referell be a good idea or should I first try OTC meds? And diet changes?",claim_per_exp,I tried a zantac.

1089,sg64st,t5_2s23e,"Gonna get tested for Ms soon, very sad and scared
Hi everyone. I'm 28 years old now. When I was 21 I got a weird feeling on my abdomen under right rib. Very slowly it spread the whole abdomen and the intensity increased. Right now it spread all of my trunk. I sometimes have hot and cold sensations. I read about Ms hug and this is very similar except it doesn't go away. Ever. 

I've never thought it could be neurological pain. I had no other symptoms for until last year around this time. I started to have same dull constant pain on my right eye with other problems on my both eyes. And numbness and tingling sensations on my hand and feet since couple of months. And recently my right arm feels numb and weak, maybe since two or three months. I went to see a neurologist couple days ago. I went to many other doctors they couldn't diagnose it, this is the first time a neurologist saw me. 

Problems with my eyes feet and hands made me very depressed. I've been crying since last night (it's around noon here) because I don't feel some parts of my body and I'm thinking I'm gonna be disabled someday. I'm gonna have an MRI of my brain next week I'm scared and sad.

I'm just wondering if anyone started like this with very mild constant feeling that is in an uncommon area like abdomen. Or if anyone had constant discomfort like tightness and weight and or numbness but not sharp pain, nobody understands how it is to have this.

But i want to tell you my nightmare so sit down grab a mug of warm water and relax it will be a lot to cover.

I suffer from digestive issues that randomly appear and disappear for almost 3 months.

Month 1 was a huge nightmare, i can't walk anywhere or eat anything i was dealing with diarrhea ,bloating and a lot of cramp, colons spasms on the left side under the belly button, i used to fart 10+ time day. I had yellow stool for 2 days in the first month and since then i never pooped yellow. I even developed some kind of anxiety of using public transportation.

The biggest issue was i cant walk anywhere because i keep had a huge urge to stool despite being empty, i can feel my sigmoid and anal canal heavy and it was hurting when i used to walk.

Month 2 : In the first part of the month 2 all the symptoms started to lower in intensity, i can eat almost anything without experience bloating but diarrhea dint calmed down. In one morning i woke up and started to vomit clear liquid until i started to vomit my own bile.

Month 3 : Months 3 started to become a little easy, bloating from any food and excesive farts went away, but i can still feel my sigmoid and anal canal heavy but this time it stopped hurt at every step i was just feeling like im full and need to go at toilet. Now i was dealing with morning nausea and vomiting. At first i thought it was i went sleep hungry, but i can't sleep when my belly is full.

Now maybe you asking why i dint went to doctor in these months. I live in Romania and here we have a medical insurance called C.N.A.S and my insurance needed a new ..reform,, unfortunately they were moving like snails. And took them 2-3 months to finish all the papers or simply they forgot about me.

I've been on lamotrigine for over 2 years now and it has worked flawlessly, fully seizure free over that time. However I've noticed now I have extremely vivid and sometimes gruesome dreams that genuinely disturb me; In these dreams my girlfriend died 3 times and broke up with me once (it took me 15 minutes to realise it wasn't real after waking up), there was a nuclear apocalypse where i saw two bombs go off and shielded myself behind some sort of door, people then rose from the dead as mutants and tried to kill me, my house was blown up with my whole family in it after a world war 2 era bomb was dropped right outside.

Waking up is also extremely difficult, not like normal difficult, genuinely strange. When I wake up I'm extremely confused and have conversations with people and I think I'm saying things but I'm not, I then suddenly say something totally irrelevant and not related to anything at all and it doesn't make sense at all. I can get up, turn alarms off and go back to bed without fully waking up which makes getting up on time severely difficult, especially getting up to take the meds in the first place. I also can now sleep well over 12 hours a night if i let myself.

1113,sklumd,t5_2tyg2,"Isolated psychotic symptoms
Hey guys, so I just had an appointment with my psychiatrist, I'm on meds for generalized and social anxiety disorder. We were discussing the med stuff and I decided to open up (I trust him a lot, he's like, probably one of the best doctors in my country) about some voices inside my head that I tend to hear as if they weren't mine, as well as almost constant, random music, sometimes it's songs that I like and sometimes I hate them, but I can't stop it, since it feels like someone else is playing music and I just have to put up with it. The voices are female or male, it depends, they usually criticize others in harsh and mean ways, and I get distressed by it. Sometimes when I wake up they just start chatting as if it's nobody's business and when I'm walking on the streets they suggest that people are watching me. At my worst states they would usually command me to harm myself or commit suic*de, thankfully that hasn't happened for a long time. Sometimes it's like somebody is shoving all sorts of imagery on my face (but it's inside my head), without voices, just very vivid images, so vivid that it feels as if I can't see what's in front of my eyes for a few seconds. 
I've mentioned this to a couple doctors in the past and they either say I'm bipolar, although I have no signs of hypomania or depression, or that I'm psychotic and put me on antipsychotics. What I was telling my current doctor is that I've tried 5 different APs in various dosages and I feel absolutely miserable on them. If anything, it makes the problem a lot worse. He explained to me that there are people who have isolated psychotic symptoms without having a full blown psychotic disorder, and that he noticed it's mostly genetic (my dad has this issue as well as my uncle and my aunt on my mom's side), but the problem with treating it is that people who have it, usually react very poorly to most if not all APs. He said that we should wait a few months, and if it becomes unbearable, then we can start trying a low dose of an AP that I haven't tried before. He's not very concerned since I'm always aware of it. Last year I used to have paranoid thoughts about people, including my own family, wanting to harm me, but I knew it was not true. It was extremely uncomfortable and hellish but I realized it was just my brain making stuff up. I went into two different antipsychotics for that reason last year and none of them worked.
Does anybody here has this same issue? What med has helped? I already eat pretty healthy and go for a walk almost everyday for an hour. I also have a consistent but flexible routine/schedule and try to keep my mind occupied with the various tasks I do during the day. 

The meds I've tried so far: *Risperidone* - caused dissociation and lots of anxiety, lost my period on it, made me suicidal and I tried dosages from 0,5 up to 2mg / *Haldol* - absolute hell on earth, couldn't live any more than two days on it, felt like a literal alien, everything was foreing to me, even my own voice, only took 2,5mg / *Abilify* - extreme anxiety and akathisia even on 5mg / *Zyprexa* - honestly I don't know if my brain even functioned at all, couldn't be bothered if I was alive or not, gained tons of weight despite eating almost nothing because I was sleeping all day, 10mg and ridiculously expensive / *Seroquel* - made me sleep for 11 hours straight and I was only on 25mg so I don't know what a higher dose would do to me.

TLDR / I have isolated psychotic symptoms (hearing other people inside my head telling me to do harmful stuff and criticizing other people, flashes of very vivid images as if they were ""visions"", paranoid thoughts around my family and people in general) without meeting the criteria for a psychotic disorder, and I actually realize it's all fabricated by my own brain every time. I tried 5 different APs and none of them worked, in fact I felt way worse. Doctor told me it's very common for people with my issue to react poorly to most APs.

Hi,

I have been dealing with GERD for a little over a year now. I'm on pantoprazole 40mg 2x/day and while that has helped with symptoms, and I am doing much better than I was when symptoms first began, I still experience symptoms such as regurgitation, burping, bloating, etc.

I am a little worried about this medication because of the long list of potential side effects. Does anyone have any experience with this? My question is, from my understanding, you can only take this med up to 12 weeks. Does it only help provide relief for the time you're on the medication, or does it have a long-lasting effect that is beneficial?

1117,oorxt9,t5_2syer,"Question about lingering pain two weeks after a bad gout attack.
So I'll just start off by saying I'm in pretty good shape, eat healthy and all that, bike and workout, but around 20lbs overweight (Male around 5'8 185lbs right now) mostly due to COVID which I'm trying to lose now, and have only gotten 3 gout attacks in my life, basically once per year for the past three years.  Every time it has happened when losing weight quickly.  Twice was during Keto diets, and this time while intermittent fasting. It's annoying but it is what it is. After losing 10lbs in 2 weeks my latest Gout attack happened.

The first two times definitely sucked.  The worst pain I've ever felt for a day or two tops.  The first time I got a shot in my big toe and that helped and had allopurinol but honestly, it makes me tired and depressed so I only took it for a limited time.  Either way, I was fully healed after a week.

The second time I got it it wasn't as bad and I just walked it off.  Again, a day of misery, and the lingering pain went away fully in a week.

This time was by far the worst.  I've never felt any pain like it.  My body would go through points of ecstasy if I would touch or hit it by accident where the pain was so bad that I basically went numb for a second and felt surprisingly pleasurable until going back to reality and the worst pain ever.

Anyways, that was July 8th, so tomorrow will be two weeks ago.  I'm just worried now because usually, I was completely fine after a week or two but now I am not.  I definitely don't have a flare-up or anything and I'm not swollen and it's fine to touch or walk on but I have the lingering pain in my left toe where I still can't walk flat-footed and need to kinda walk awkwardly on the left side of my left foot.  Luckily I can still bike but I can't run or play tennis or golf or anything.  Walking is still awkward.

Should I be worried?  It's never lasted this long. Should I try the allopurinol again?  I have to work and it makes me feel like shit and tired.  Or should I go out and buy tons of cherries?  I haven't tried any remedies tbh cause it's never lasted long enough.   I drink a lot of water but I can always drink more.  I drink a ton of coffee but I'm not sure if that counts as water.   I'm still fasting and losing weight because that's more important to me than my foot and I'm hoping when I'm back down to like 165-170 I won't have any gout issues.

Should I just take stuff for the pain?  Can this permanently damage my foot?  I don't really eat or do things that normally trigger gout.  Like I said it has ONLY happened when I've lost like 10lbs pretty quickly.

Every time it has happened when losing weight quickly.  Twice was during Keto diets, and this time while intermittent fasting. It's annoying but it is what it is. After losing 10lbs in 2 weeks my latest Gout attack happened.

The first two times definitely sucked.  The worst pain I've ever felt for a day or two tops.  The first time I got a shot in my big toe and that helped and had allopurinol but honestly, it makes me tired and depressed so I only took it for a limited time.  Either way, I was fully healed after a week.

The second time I got it it wasn't as bad and I just walked it off.  Again, a day of misery, and the lingering pain went away fully in a week.

This time was by far the worst.  I've never felt any pain like it.  My body would go through points of ecstasy if I would touch or hit it by accident where the pain was so bad that I basically went numb for a second and felt surprisingly pleasurable until going back to reality and the worst pain ever.

Anyways, that was July 8th, so tomorrow will be two weeks ago.  I'm just worried now because usually, I was completely fine after a week or two but now I am not.  I definitely don't have a flare-up or anything and I'm not swollen and it's fine to touch or walk on but I have the lingering pain in my left toe where I still can't walk flat-footed and need to kinda walk awkwardly on the left side of my left foot.  Luckily I can still bike but I can't run or play tennis or golf or anything.  Walking is still awkward.

Should I be worried?  It's never lasted this long. Should I try the allopurinol again?  I have to work and it makes me feel like shit and tired.  Or should I go out and buy tons of cherries?  I haven't tried any remedies tbh cause it's never lasted long enough.   I drink a lot of water but I can always drink more.  I drink a ton of coffee but I'm not sure if that counts as water.   I'm still fasting and losing weight because that's more important to me than my foot and I'm hoping when I'm back down to like 165-170 I won't have any gout issues.

Should I just take stuff for the pain?  Can this permanently damage my foot?  I don't really eat or do things that normally trigger gout.  Like I said it has ONLY happened when I've lost like 10lbs pretty quickly.

Thanks guys.  Appreciate any advice.",claim_per_exp,"The second time I got it it wasn't as bad and I just walked it off.  Again, a day of misery, and the lingering pain went away fully in a week.

For background I've had got 3 or 4 times in the last probably 8 years. Usually as a result of stress or, in my current case I suspect dehydration for over a week.

However two days ago I woke up with a slightly hot pain around the bottom of my right (good) big toe. It hasn't got any worse since and there's no swelling yet although the skin is dry around the joint. I have no pain when I tap the joint and only pain when moving the toe upwards or repositioning my foot. I am assuming this is a new gout attack in my other foot, has anyone else encountered that?

1127,ss5ygy,t5_2s3g1,"I need help (IBS-C)
Im a 24M with IBS-C, and Ive been having a tremendously difficult time sleeping this last week. 

A bit of background, two months ago I got a colonoscopy on the recommendation of my GI (everything came back normal).  To combat the symptoms I was facing, the doctor recommended me Linzess (first the 145mg dosage but the last two weeks Ive been on the 290mg for reasons Ill get too soon).  It worked well for the first two weeks or so, but then I started running into issues.  

For starters, the Linzess just did not work as intended.   Even drinking more then the recommended water intake per day, adding daily usage of Mirilax, as well as changing my diet accordingly, nothing would have me go to the bathroom, other then violent diarrhea once a week which essentially would leave me in pain and unable to function during that day.  In addition, I would also feel bloated, cramped and get these horrible bouts of acid reflux (which during periods of constipation tends to come in and out at random times).  I know Linzess is a pretty polarizing medication and a lot of users on this sub seem to be split on how affective it is, I assumed that my dosage needed to be higher.  So I switched to the higher dose and all of the problems I had before just intensified.  

The worst development as of late has been cramping, constipation, and acid reflux pains all hitting at night.  I find that these issues make me unable to relax and Im currently typing this on the third out of last four days where I am unable to fall asleep due to the factors I just listed.  I have reduced my diet to a very strict low FODMAP, even eating many hours before bed, but this does not seem to quell anything.  Im perpetually tired and unable to even enjoy going out for a walk due to both fatigue and fear that these symptoms will spring up while Im walking.   Pair everything I just mentioned with a phobia of throwing up, and you have an absolute spiral. 

I have a few ideas of what I need to accomplish:

1) Call GI to talk about alternatives to Linzess/ further testing
2) Seek therapy to work on anxiety 
3) keep a food journal to more accurately see what foods trigger me the most

In the interim, does anyone on here have any wisdom on how to deal with the symptoms I mentioned at night?  Im open to any suggestion.

Some people are fortunate enough to be able to control their epilepsy through diet. I myself am one of them. It was a long and lonely journey to figure this out on my own but now that I understand what caused my epilepsy, I have determined I was ""fat deficient"" much the same way a person would be vitamin deficient.

Growing up, we didn't have good food. I usually ate cereal, junk food, or whatever crap the public school was offering. And my doctor told to me to avoid fat at all costs. Now that I'm older, I can see that fat is not only good, it is necessary for survival.

>Your brain is 60 per cent fat.

What is important is the quality of fat.

* Seeds (Flax, chia)

A lot of people (myself included) turn to keto without really understanding why it works. Fat is the glue that holds your neurons together.

For a long time, I thought my medication was the reason i was having small conscious seizures. I switched medication and it seemed to stop.

 but now I remember having strange convulsive cold shivering episodes while a teenager. on top of this for four years now they have returned. with a vengeance. Slowly like maybe once every five months i would have small convulsive episodes. they built up to happening almost once a week and they are no longer just convulsions. 

Now mostly the upper half of my body starts stiffening and twitches then stiff shaking, including my breathing. I am awake the whole time and if I try to fight it they get harder and last longer. I don't get a metal taste in my mouth, but I can feel them when they are trying to come on. like internal body tremor, brain fog, slight dizzy confusion, a faint falling yet floating feeling. 

I am on completely different medication then the last time.

I (26F) had suffered with severe heartburn for years, but Tums, Pepto and a glass of milk seemed to help. In January 2021, I had severe, sharp, crushing chest pain that radiated to my teeth and back and I thought I was having a heart attack. I went to the ER and they did all the cardiac blood tests,  an EKG, and a D-Dimer to look for clots. Everything checked out normal and they sent me home, only for it to happen over and over. Sometimes I would get one every day, and sometimes I wouldn't get one for weeks. I suffered with those pains all through the summer, until I finally reached out to my PCP in November. After some discussion she diagnosed me with GERD, and told me my chest pains were esophageal spasms. She had me take Zantac-360 for six weeks, which helped with the heartburn but overall didn't stop the spasms.

Last Saturday (1/1/22) I began having severe stomach pains along with a spasm. It felt like a hot fist just clenching in my stomach over and over. I had some chest heaviness with it, and my anxiety was through the roof. I dealt with it for a few  days and finally went in yesterday to get it checked out, with a new doctor. She did labs on me (all normal), and prescribed me Protonix for six weeks to see if that would ultimately stop my spasms, stomach pain and heartburn. I've done some research on Protonix and noticed some people have severe side effects - some people have mild - and some have none at all. I took my first pill last night and I'm feeling a little anxious as to what might happen. I worry about heart palpitations and seizures, as my family has a history of heart issues.

How many of you have been on Protonix? What were your experiences? Are there short-term side effects or do the most serious side effects only occur if you are on it long-term?

Also, if anyone has any input on esophageal spasms or the chest pains associated with GERD, I'd love to hear any advice/stories on that too. This has been the scariest part for me.

\*WARNING LONG POST\*

Hey everyone,

I am suffering from my first Gout flare-up. I would like to share what is happening and get some advice, hear feedback etc.

I'm 31 years old, lean muscular body, athletic, healthy mostly plant-based diet, barely drink. Not always been like this though.

I have suffered from psoriasis and IBS (accompanied with Insomnia) since I've been young, but both have been under control for a while. When I was a teenager and early 20s I was very unhealthy. Exessive alcohol, red meat, and lots of processed carbs. I started getting really sick, like really bad IBS. As well as getting ill I would also feel sick/bloated after food. My psoriasis was also horrible, with thick plaques on my head and on parts of my body and legs. I stopped eating meat about 9 years ago and through trial and error noticed that gluten was making me feel sick after eating. After cutting these out, my IBS started getting better and would only have occasional flare-ups. I still drank too much and that had an impact on my psoriasis which remained persistent. Not sleeping would give me trouble and so I would drink to sleep, an unhealthy shitty cycle.

About 6 years ago I cut sugar out my diet pretty much, weaned myself onto dark dark chocolate (which I now love), drank less and started using topical/oral CBD. My psoriasis started clearing up.

Then for the last 4 years, I really switched my life around. I started taking various longevity supplements, eating pretty much keto (pescatarian), started sporting 7 days a week. I went from being overweight/fat (85kg+) to 66kg muscular/lean. I cut alcohol down to a bare minimum. Every few weeks I may have a few cocktails or a few more with the occasional party, and many times months with no drinking.  My psoriasis disappeared and IBS was virtually non-existent (spare from when I stupidly couldn't resist a few bits from my GFs delicious-looking pizza). I would like to add that I have also cooked almost every day for the past few years, healthy delicious fresh food.

About a year ago I started getting joint pain after having a fairly serious combat sports injury in my hip, which resulted in my knees being damaged too.  I went and received stem cell treatment in September. This worked and my injury was pretty much healed but I was very aware that my joints in general were super stuff and clicked (way more than the average person).

Then in October, my house burned down in a horrible accident whilst I was away on holiday. I spent November and December living in a hotel room, before staying at a friend's place for Xmas and new year, before flying to Mexico (where I am currently). During the period in the Hotel, my diet slipped slightly, I was having to eat more processed foods (room service) but nothing crazy unhealthy.

Over the holiday period, I drank way more than I usually would. Xmas eve, day n boxing day. Nye, day and the day after. A lot for me but not a lot compared to most people I know. My diet was less healthy than usual and I had more sugar than my usual (almost zero) but still hardly any in the grand scheme of things. I then flew to Mexico a week ago and had 3 nights where I had alcoholic drinks and a fair amount of seafood.

Then 3 days ago after cycling 20km I went to go get a glass of water and suddenly felt immense pain in my foot. I immediately thought I had broken my foot. My toe/foot was swollen at the side and shiny red. I don't really like visiting hospitals or doctors after being given so much bad advice/medicine previously, so I thought I would wait and see if it was as bad the next day. That night I thought I was dying, which sounds so stupid as it was just a foot! I hobbled to the hospital yesterday and they did an x-ray and blood test. Lo and behold my uric acid level was 8.0 and my inflammatory markers were way high.

They told me I had gout and gave me some prescriptions and a bunch of painkillers. I've lived to deal with chronic pain (without painkillers) for years with my IBS and the injury I mentioned previously however this is a whole new level. Last night I caved and took a lot of painkillers, which only slightly helped.

I am currently sitting here in agony after drinking water with lemon all day (many litres) needing to hobble to the toilet constantly. To all those who have been suffering from this before, wow, fair play. It is horrible.

All the videos/advice online tells me to follow a certain diet (similar to how I eat already) and drink little alcohol (the moderate amount is WAY more than I drink!). I assume that the 2 months of being slightly less healthy have caused this, but it seems pretty crazy that it could cause something that quick and when in comparison to many people it's still been a healthy two months. Going by what I read online, my diet lately just doesn't seem unhealthy compared to what people eat on average, especially those who often suffer from Gout

I wonder if anyone else has Gout who has experienced something similar?

Anybody live a healthy lifestyle and is a similar age but suffer from inflammation-induced Gout?

I read online those with Psoriasis can have higher chances (3 to 5x) more of developing it even if healthy. If so what can you do? I would like to add that I had a TINY patch of Psoriasis appearing after being stressed from the fire, but still a minor flare-up.

I also wondered how effective tart cherry supplements are? I already have been taking MSM and other recommend joint supplements for years.

Does anyone know about the likelihood of it returning and also developing into Psoriatic arthritis (my biggest fear)?

Hi, I was wondering if anyone else has dealt with severe bloating while on active flair or as a side effect of their medications?

I've been on flare recently (SLE Lupus Nephitis) and they put me on oral chemo along with a high dose of steroids.

I've benefited so much from others posting about medication experiences so I wanted to share about starting Kesimpta. Also, I'm scared! Posting here is helping me feel less alone.

30 minutes before injection I took the sensory pen out of the fridge and took 1000 mg Tylenol, 25mg Benadryl, and 20mg Pepcid (as recommended by pharmacist). I did the shot at 8:30pm. It did hurt a little but it wasn't awful.

Has that happened to anyone else?

I'll update after tonight on any side effects I experience. I've got more Tylenol standing by.

UPDATE: I watched Moonstruck and went to bed around 11 feeling fine.At some point in the night I woke up to use the bathroom and felt dizzy and nauseous, almost like I was going to faint. Back in bed I continued to feel nauseous and had body aches and chills.

Woke up feeling better but very tired and spacy. I was able to take a sick day from work so I'll rest up today. I hear the first dose can be the worst, so hopefully things will get easier from here!

UPDATE: About five days after my first injection, I started feeling tingling in my right foot. I've never experienced tingling in that foot before now. Updated my neurologist but have yet to hear back.

Hey everyone,  


So my GI suspects I have IBS-D.  Going to do a colonoscopy to confirm, but she seems fairly confident at this point.  


My symptoms are (I think) actually pretty mild probably comparatively to most people.  The only thing I experience is the morning rush every morning (except Sundays, oddly).  Usually lasts a couple hours; cramping, going to the bathroom, etc.  My stools aren't actually full on liquid - they're pretty solid and formed, tbh - just a lot of them.  


The rest of the day I'm 100% fine - no pain, no bloating, no gas, no nausea, nothing.  I can eat whatever I want for lunch and dinner and snacks and have no issues afterwards at all.  This makes trying an elimination diet challenging because afaik, I don't think I have any food triggers.    


My breakfast is usually either a protein shake, eggs, a muffin or cereal.  I've tried these at other times during the day and I don't react, so I feel like it's not a food thing, but likely a gut waking up from sleep and then going into overdrive thing.  


I've been trying a few different probiotics - the most successful one I THINK was S. boulardii , but I think after a week it actually started giving my constipation.  I've been trying a few others without too much luck - first I tried a few strains of specific IBS-D mixes, and now I'm on RenewLife Ultimate Flora (50b), though only for about 4-5 days so far, so too early to tell.  


Wondering if anyone else with a similar situation to me had success with any specific strains?

I was offered a phone consultation with a nurse practioner who immediately said gout and prescribed naproxen.

25 days ago I noticed a pain in my big toe, thought nothing of it.  The next day it was swollem, hot and painful.  I assumed I'd sprained it as I'd been doing some quite intense walking the day before the initial pain appeared. 

I was offered a phone consultation with a nurse practioner who immediately said gout and prescribed naproxen. The naproxen certainly brought the swelling down but I'm still suffering moderate pain and it is still at least slightly swollen (seems to get better then worse).  I've had a blood test where results were apparently consistent with gout. 

Finally managed to speak to a GP today, asked the number and he said 5.64. Also said kidney function OK, liver function OK, blood count fine. 

I'm not asking for a diagnosis here, but is it normal for a first attack to drag on so long? And that 5.64 number seems to be normal from what I've read? Perhaps high side of normal.  Going to phone back tomorrow and ask for confirmation on that number.

It's quite frustrating as I've been unable to get a doctor to actually examine me, in my mind this could all still be an injury, and one that needs intervention.  Am I wrong?

1178,speov8,t5_2s3g1,"Ibs or something else? Need help, Not sure whats wrong with me
Hi guys, I would really really appreciate it if some people could share what they think or have any other useful/helpful information.

I have had GI issues for exactly 1 year now, I have symptoms every single day no exceptions usually starts in the afternoon and worse with each meal, currently symptoms are lots of burping, almost always bloated and after meals it gets worse, almost always uncomfortable feeling after eating not really pain but just doesn't feel good, brain fog. I do not have any diarrhea or hard stools not sure if I have constipation though I go like 70/100 of what I should be going per day, but I do have a change in bowel habits started about a year ago and never changed since. Used to go once every other day in evening now I got twice a day everyday once when i wake up and once after morning coffee.All symptoms started Feb 2021. Oct-Nov of 2021 was my worst I would have lost of pain after eating anything but it suddenly stopped. Also really important- about 2 months ago I started having constant headaches every day starting at noon for 6 weeks straight I couldn't take it anymore so I went to a neurologist and they have me 10mg nortriptyline once a day. Has helped for the pain a lot, but I still have random impulses in my head i can feel, also dizziness after moving hasn't gone away really. When I had colonoscopy and endoscopy done after it for 1 week my abdomen and stomach hurt a ton. Also had some sleeping problems for 2 weeks which went away. I fell way better in the morning compared to the afternoon/night.

BTW I am a 21yr old male (if that matters)

So far Its been 1 year and have gone to 2 gastroenterologists and 1 neurologist for the headache that recently started.

Tests done- ultrasound (but ultrasound was 1 year ago), colonoscopy and endoscopy, xray, lots of blood tests, 2 stool tests, but I think they only checked inflammation nothing else. Have not had any Mris cat scans or functional tests done. All tests came fine besides vitamin d was low, my blood MPV count was 12.1 when i think people my age should only be at around 8, and some type of antibody was slightly increased but just a little.

Medicines tried - Ibgard, antibiotic for 10 days, some probiotics, some homeopathy, natural antibiotic bee propolis for 1 month, nothing did much besides the bee propolis kind of removed bloating. not sure if its sibo but I know sibo relapses if underlying cause is not treated so.

Last small important thing - when I go jogging or exercise I get side stiches in the bottom left kind of feels like spleen but i know its higher up, when acitivity is stopped it goes away.

MAIN QUESTION - Not sure if its IBS or not? as ibs main symptoms are pain and diarrhea or constipation and I dont seem to have that really. sorry for my long essay :)

Thank you to the people that say their opinion I REALLY appreciate it and have a wonderful splended day, hopefully we will all feel better! feel free to leave questions",claim_per_exp,"

I wanted to share my story in hopes it could possibly help someone or there are other people going through what I'm experiencing.   
Like many others here my story began several years ago with constant nagging, gnawing heartburn for which I was prescribed Omeprazole. This seemed to remedy my symptoms, and even though I've always had a fear/aversion to being on a long-term medication before I knew it, it had been 3 years or so. Until one day the original symptoms came back, and this time way worse. I began experiencing that feeling of a fist trying to punch its way up and out of my chest. I even questioned if I had heart issues. It was pretty awful, so after several rounds of tests, including an Endoscopy, I was told I had a hiatal hernia. The GI Dr. switched me from 20 mg of Omeprazole to 40 mg and Pantoprazole and that calmed down the pain. Again, even though I was still wary of an even higher dose of daily medication, being relieved of the pain outweighed these fears and before I knew it, another 3 or so years had gone by being a slave to this drug.   
Then about a year ago I began having horrible pain in my pelvic region. I won't go into all the details, but nothing about it made me think it was a GI issue, more of a urologic issue. So after rounds of antibiotics for what they thought was prostatitis, CT scans, and even cystoscopy (if you don't know that that is look it up. Basically medieval torture!) - all of it inconclusive. I was so desperate I even tried acupuncture which did nothing. I was beginning to believe I had CPPS (chronic pelvic pain syndrome), when as a last-ditch desperate move I decided to try eliminating gluten from my diet. To my astonishment, within a little over a week, all of my symptoms magically vanished!  
I'm about 8 months into my gluten-free diet and feel great, but I began questioning what could have caused this. Why at the age of 41 did my body suddenly decide to reject gluten? I did a celiac test and it was negative and have no family history of gluten intolerance. After doing some research I came across a study that found a link between [PPI use and gluten intolerance](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3947159/) and my jaw hit the floor.  
I now believe this long-term use of PPIs has caused this and am currently in the process of trying to wean off the Pantoprazole by cutting it in half and taking it only every other day. The GERD symptoms have returned however so I've scheduled another appt with the GI Dr to discuss a way forward without PPIs. I'm holding out a small bit of hope that if I'm able to completely go off the PPPs the gluten intolerance could possibly reverse, but I know that's not likely.

Until one day the original symptoms came back, and this time way worse. I began experiencing that feeling of a fist trying to punch its way up and out of my chest. I even questioned if I had heart issues. It was pretty awful, so after several rounds of tests, including an Endoscopy, I was told I had a hiatal hernia. The GI Dr. switched me from 20 mg of Omeprazole to 40 mg and Pantoprazole and that calmed down the pain. Again, even though I was still wary of an even higher dose of daily medication, being relieved of the pain outweighed these fears and before I knew it, another 3 or so years had gone by being a slave to this drug.   
Then about a year ago I began having horrible pain in my pelvic region. I won't go into all the details, but nothing about it made me think it was a GI issue, more of a urologic issue. So after rounds of antibiotics for what they thought was prostatitis, CT scans, and even cystoscopy (if you don't know that that is look it up. Basically medieval torture!) - all of it inconclusive. I was so desperate I even tried acupuncture which did nothing. I was beginning to believe I had CPPS (chronic pelvic pain syndrome), when as a last-ditch desperate move I decided to try eliminating gluten from my diet. To my astonishment, within a little over a week, all of my symptoms magically vanished!  
I'm about 8 months into my gluten-free diet and feel great, but I began questioning what could have caused this. Why at the age of 41 did my body suddenly decide to reject gluten? I did a celiac test and it was negative and have no family history of gluten intolerance. After doing some research I came across a study that found a link between [PPI use and gluten intolerance](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3947159/) and my jaw hit the floor.  
I now believe this long-term use of PPIs has caused this and am currently in the process of trying to wean off the Pantoprazole by cutting it in half and taking it only every other day. The GERD symptoms have returned however so I've scheduled another appt with the GI Dr to discuss a way forward without PPIs. I'm holding out a small bit of hope that if I'm able to completely go off the PPPs the gluten intolerance could possibly reverse, but I know that's not likely.   
Does anyone have any alternative approaches besides the obvious diet restrictions to keep GURD at bay without this evil medication?",claim_per_exp," when as a last-ditch desperate move I decided to try eliminating gluten from my diet.
